## Human Selection Ontological Identity

### What Human Selection IS

**Human Selection is an explicit, non-inferable, non-automatable human action that chooses from available options.**

**Human Selection:**
- Is explicitly performed by humans
- Cannot be inferred or derived
- Cannot be automated
- Does NOT equal recommendation
- Does NOT equal execution
- Is a sovereign human decision

**Human Selection provides:**
- Explicit human choice from available options
- Human decision sovereignty
- Non-compressible decision space
- Irreducible human agency

### What Human Selection IS NOT

**Human Selection is NOT:**
- ❌ System inference
- ❌ Automatic selection
- ❌ Recommendation
- ❌ Default choice
- ❌ Execution
- ❌ AI suggestion
- ❌ System judgment

**Human Selection does NOT:**
- ❌ Infer from context
- ❌ Derive from audit data
- ❌ Automate based on conditions
- ❌ Recommend options
- ❌ Judge "better" or "optimal"
- ❌ Compress decision space

---

## Three Non-Negotiable Principles

### Principle 1: Selection is Human-Explicit Behavior, NOT System Inference

**Selection MUST be human-explicit behavior, NOT system inference.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Selection is explicitly performed by humans
- ✅ Selection cannot be inferred by system
- ✅ Selection cannot be derived from context
- ✅ Selection cannot be automated

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ System may infer selection from context
- ❌ System may derive selection from audit data
- ❌ System may automate selection based on conditions
- ❌ System may suggest selection

**Enforcement:**
- All selection MUST be explicitly initiated by humans
- No selection inference logic may exist
- No selection automation logic may be encoded
- No selection suggestion logic may be performed

---

### Principle 2: Presentation ≠ Recommendation ≠ Judgment ≠ Default

**Presentation, Recommendation, Judgment, and Default are distinct and MUST NOT be conflated.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Information presentation is allowed (factual display)
- ✅ Filtering is allowed (reducing set based on criteria)
- ✅ Ordering is allowed (sorting based on criteria)
- ✅ Highlighting is allowed (emphasizing based on criteria)
- ❌ Recommendation is FORBIDDEN (suggesting "use this")
- ❌ Judgment is FORBIDDEN (evaluating "better" or "optimal")
- ❌ Default selection is FORBIDDEN (pre-selecting option)

**Enforcement:**
- Presentation, filtering, ordering, and highlighting are allowed
- Recommendation, judgment, and default selection are FORBIDDEN
- No conflation between allowed and forbidden semantics

---

### Principle 3: AI May Expand Information Space, But MUST NOT Compress Decision Space

**AI may expand information space, but MUST NOT compress decision space.**

**This means:**
- ✅ AI may provide additional information
- ✅ AI may provide filtering options
- ✅ AI may provide ordering options
- ✅ AI may provide highlighting options
- ❌ AI MUST NOT reduce available options
- ❌ AI MUST NOT hide options
- ❌ AI MUST NOT pre-select options
- ❌ AI MUST NOT recommend options

**Enforcement:**
- AI may expand information available to humans
- AI MUST NOT reduce options available to humans
- AI MUST NOT compress human decision space
- AI MUST NOT influence human selection

---

## Selection Behavior Definition

### Selection is Explicit Human Action

**Selection is an explicit human action that chooses from available options.**

**Selection Behavior:**
- ✅ Human explicitly chooses an option
- ✅ Human explicitly indicates selection
- ✅ Selection is recorded as human action
- ✅ Selection is non-inferable

**Selection Behavior Does NOT:**
- ❌ Infer from context
- ❌ Derive from audit data
- ❌ Automate based on conditions
- ❌ Recommend options
- ❌ Judge options

---

### Selection ≠ Execution

**Selection does NOT equal execution.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Selection is choosing an option
- ✅ Execution is performing an action
- ✅ Selection may precede execution
- ✅ Selection does NOT automatically trigger execution

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Selection automatically executes
- ❌ Selection triggers execution
- ❌ Selection coordinates execution

---

## Selection Audit Characteristics

### Selection May Generate Audit Records

**Selection may generate audit records (A3).**

**Allowed Semantics:**
- ✅ Selection event may be recorded as audit record
- ✅ Audit record contains factual information about selection
- ✅ Audit record is passive and read-only
- ✅ Audit record enables human review of selection history

**Explicit Forbidden Semantics:**
- ❌ MUST NOT evaluate selection for decision-making
- ❌ MUST NOT trigger behavior based on selection audit
- ❌ MUST NOT interpret selection audit as success/failure
- ❌ MUST NOT use selection audit to influence future selections

**Audit Record Content:**
- ✅ Event type: "human_selection"
- ✅ Selected option identifier
- ✅ Selection timestamp
- ✅ Selector identifier
- ✅ Available options at time of selection (factual)
- ✅ Descriptive metadata (factual only)

---

### Selection Audit is Passive and Read-Only

**Selection audit records are passive and read-only.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Audit records are descriptive records only
- ✅ Audit records are read-only (cannot be modified after creation)
- ✅ Audit records are non-behavioral (do not affect system behavior)
- ✅ Audit records provide evidence for human review only

**Explicit Constraints:**
- Selection audit records MUST NOT trigger actions
- Selection audit records MUST NOT influence behavior
- Selection audit records MUST NOT control system state
- Selection audit records MUST NOT be evaluated for decision-making
