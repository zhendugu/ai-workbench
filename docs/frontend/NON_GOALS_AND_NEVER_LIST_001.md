## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document establishes a **normative and binding** list of things this system will **NEVER** become. This list is:

- **Normative**: Defines correct behavior and boundaries
- **Binding**: Cannot be violated without explicit extension through a new document
- **Permanent**: Applies to all current and future states of the frozen system
- **Declarative**: States what is forbidden, not what might be possible

## 6. Normative Enforcement

### 6.1 Binding Nature

This list is **binding**:

- Violations of this list require explicit extension through a new document
- No feature may be added that contradicts items on this list
- No interpretation may extend the system beyond these boundaries
- This list takes precedence over ambiguous requirements

### 6.2 Extension Process

To extend beyond this list:

1. Create a new document (NON-GOALS-AND-NEVER-LIST-002.md or similar)
2. Explicitly state what is being removed from the never list
3. Provide rationale for the extension
4. Require explicit approval before implementation

### 6.3 No Implied Exceptions

**No exceptions are implied:**

- Silence does not imply permission
- Unlisted items are not automatically allowed if they violate the spirit of this list
- Analogous features to prohibited items are also prohibited
- Future technologies do not automatically enable prohibited capabilities
