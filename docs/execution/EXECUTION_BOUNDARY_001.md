# Execution Boundary Declaration 001

**Document ID**: EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-001

**Status**: FROZEN

**Date**: 2025-12-28

**Authority**: docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)

## Core Declaration

**This system is a declarative, inert structural registry.**

The system declares structural facts. It does not execute actions.

The system records what exists. It does not trigger effects.

The system stores immutable snapshots. It does not schedule, deploy, activate, or run anything.

**Execution is permanently out of scope by design.**

---

## What This System Does NOT Do

### 1. The System Does Not Execute Actions

- The system does not run code
- The system does not execute commands
- The system does not perform operations
- The system does not trigger actions
- The system does not invoke functions
- The system does not call APIs (except to read data)

### 2. The System Does Not Trigger Effects

- The system does not cause side effects
- The system does not modify external state
- The system does not send notifications
- The system does not emit events
- The system does not trigger workflows
- The system does not initiate processes

### 3. The System Does Not Schedule, Deploy, Activate, or Run Anything

- The system does not schedule tasks
- The system does not deploy code
- The system does not activate systems
- The system does not run services
- The system does not start processes
- The system does not launch applications
- The system does not trigger deployments
- The system does not initiate executions

### 4. The System Does Not Monitor, Control, or Manage Execution

- The system does not monitor running processes
- The system does not control execution state
- The system does not manage active services
- The system does not observe real-time operations
- The system does not track execution progress
- The system does not report execution status

---

## What This System Does

### Declaration of Structure

This system declares and stores structural facts:

- Company organizational structure (Cells, Roles, Topology)
- Methodology perspective metadata
- Freeze records (provenance facts)

These are **static, immutable declarations** of what exists, not instructions for what to do.

### Read-Only Presentation

The system presents frozen structural declarations in a read-only interface:

- Display of frozen Company structures
- Viewing of Cell responsibility declarations
- Presentation of Topology relationships
- Showing of Methodology context
- Display of Freeze provenance records

The presentation is **read-only**. It does not control anything. It does not trigger anything.

---

## Real-World Execution (Explicitly External)

**Real-world execution of organizational structures is explicitly external and unrelated to this system.**

If a Company's declared structure is implemented in the real world:

- That implementation happens outside this system
- This system has no connection to that implementation
- This system does not control that implementation
- This system does not monitor that implementation
- This system does not trigger that implementation
- This system does not schedule that implementation

**The system declares structure. Real-world execution is someone else's concern.**

---

## Explicitly Denied Components

The following types of components are **explicitly and permanently forbidden** in this system:

### Workflow Engines
- No workflow execution engines
- No process orchestration engines
- No business process management systems

### Task Runners
- No task execution systems
- No job schedulers
- No command runners

### Agents (Human or AI)
- No autonomous agents
- No automated agents
- No AI agents that execute actions
- No human agents triggered by the system

### Automation Pipelines
- No CI/CD pipelines
- No deployment pipelines
- No automation scripts executed by the system
- No automated workflows

### Event Handlers
- No event-driven execution
- No event handlers that trigger actions
- No event listeners that cause side effects
- No event processing systems

### Queues, Jobs, Cron, Schedulers
- No job queues
- No task queues
- No cron jobs
- No schedulers
- No background workers
- No async job processors

---

## System Boundaries

### Boundary: Declaration vs. Execution

**Inside the Boundary (Allowed)**:
- Declaration of organizational structure
- Storage of immutable facts
- Read-only presentation of facts
- Viewing of frozen snapshots

**Outside the Boundary (Forbidden)**:
- Execution of actions
- Triggering of effects
- Scheduling of tasks
- Deployment of systems
- Activation of services
- Monitoring of execution
- Control of processes

### Boundary: Facts vs. Operations

**Facts (Allowed)**:
- "Cell A has responsibility X"
- "Cell A has dependency relationship to Cell B"
- "Company was frozen at timestamp T"

**Operations (Forbidden)**:
- "Run Cell A"
- "Execute process X"
- "Trigger workflow Y"
- "Schedule task Z"
- "Deploy system S"

---

## Permanent Scope Exclusion

**Execution semantics are permanently excluded from this system's scope.**

This exclusion is:

- **Explicit**: This document explicitly declares it
- **Permanent**: No future phase may introduce execution without explicit system restart
- **Enforced**: Static verification prevents introduction of execution vocabulary
- **Documented**: All execution-related terms are listed as forbidden

---

## Authority Hierarchy

This boundary declaration is subordinate to:

1. **docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md** (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)
2. **docs/authority/AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY_AND_RULES_FROZEN_001.md**

In case of conflict, DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md takes precedence.

---

**END OF EXECUTION BOUNDARY DECLARATION**

**Note**: This boundary is a permanent design constraint. Any proposal to introduce execution semantics requires explicit system restart and re-evaluation of the system's fundamental purpose.
