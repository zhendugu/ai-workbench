## Acceptance Declaration

**All Governance Layer documents are frozen and accepted as final.**

This document provides formal acceptance of all Governance Layer documents. All documents are frozen and cannot be modified without explicit authorization through the change boundary process.

## Section A: Inventory of Frozen Governance Documents

The following Governance Layer documents have been frozen:

1. **GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Declares system intent in explicit negative terms
   - States what the system is not
   - Binds interpretation to structural declaration only
   - Contains: Non-decision, Non-advice, Non-automation, Non-agent, Non-representation statements

2. **RESPONSIBILITY_AND_NON_ATTRIBUTION_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Defines responsibility boundaries
   - Explicitly denies attribution of actions, decisions, outcomes, or harm to the system
   - Establishes clear separation between description and action
   - Contains: No delegation, No transfer, No endorsement, No substitution statements

3. **MISUSE_AND_FORESEEABLE_MISINTERPRETATION_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Enumerates foreseeable ways the system could be misused or misinterpreted
   - Explicitly states that such uses are outside design intent
   - Identifies risks only (no solutions, no features)
   - Contains: AI agent misuse, Decision automation misuse, Organizational control misuse, Compliance substitution misuse, Governance theater misuse

4. **GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Creates binding list of things the system will never become
   - Uses absolute and non-future-looking language
   - Defines permanent exclusions
   - Contains: No execution engine, No recommendation engine, No decision engine, No monitoring system, No workflow system, No compliance validator, No autonomous agent, No optimization system

5. **GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY_RELATION_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Explicitly defines how Governance relates to Authority Layer
   - States that Governance does not generate facts
   - States that Governance does not override Authority
   - Contains: Authority defines what exists, Governance defines how existence may not be interpreted

6. **GOVERNANCE_PHASE_CLOSURE_NOTE_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Formally closes the Governance Layer
   - Declares that intent and responsibility framing is complete
   - References all frozen Authority, Frontend, Execution documents

7. **GCD_SEMANTIC_INHERITANCE_RESOLUTION_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Resolves semantic inheritance between GCD.md and frozen boundaries
   - Declares GCD execution/evolution semantics explicitly and permanently superseded
   - Establishes GCD.md as historical context only

8. **PROJECT_SCOPE_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT_001.md** (AUDIT REPORT)
   - Audits project scope alignment
   - Identifies no scope drift or boundary violations
   - Confirms all boundaries enforced

## Section B: Verification Checklist

### B1: No Execution Semantics

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents explicitly deny execution semantics:
- GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_001.md: "The system does not execute actions"
- GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md: "No execution engine"
- All documents use negative declarations only

### B2: No Workflow Semantics

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents explicitly deny workflow semantics:
- GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md: "No workflow system"
- All documents state system does not define or execute workflows

### B3: No Monitoring Semantics

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents explicitly deny monitoring semantics:
- GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md: "No monitoring system"
- All documents state system does not monitor operations

### B4: No Decision Semantics

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents explicitly deny decision semantics:
- GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_001.md: "The system does not make decisions"
- GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md: "No decision engine"
- All documents state system does not make or automate decisions

### B5: No Recommendation Semantics

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents explicitly deny recommendation semantics:
- GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_001.md: "The system does not provide advice"
- GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md: "No recommendation engine"
- All documents state system does not recommend or suggest

### B6: Declarative Language

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents use declarative language:
- Statements describe what is, not what should be
- No operational verbs in positive statements
- All positive statements are about boundaries and exclusions

### B7: Non-Future Language

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents use non-future language:
- Statements describe current reality
- No "will", "should", "may", "could" in positive statements
- Never list uses "will never" only in negative context

### B8: Non-Operative Language

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

All Governance documents use non-operative language:
- No instructions for implementation
- No solutions or recommendations
- No guidance or best practices
- Only boundary declarations

---

## Section C: Alignment Verification

### C1: Alignment with DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md

**Verification**: ✅ ALIGNED

All Governance documents reference DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md as highest authority. Governance documents are subordinate to Frontend Decision Record.

### C2: Alignment with EXECUTION_LAYER_CLOSURE_NOTE_001.md

**Verification**: ✅ ALIGNED

All Governance documents align with Execution Layer permanent closure:
- Governance documents deny execution semantics
- Governance documents do not introduce execution capabilities
- Governance documents respect Execution Layer boundaries

### C3: Alignment with GCD_SEMANTIC_INHERITANCE_RESOLUTION_001.md

**Verification**: ✅ ALIGNED

All Governance documents align with GCD semantic inheritance resolution:
- Governance documents do not restore GCD execution/evolution semantics
- Governance documents maintain frozen boundary precedence
- Governance documents treat GCD.md as historical context only

---

## Section D: Change Boundary Reference

**All Governance documents are subject to GOVERNANCE_CHANGE_BOUNDARY_001.md.**

Any changes to frozen Governance documents require:
1. Explicit authorization through change boundary process
2. New versioned documents (e.g., GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_002.md)
3. Formal phase transition declaration
4. Update to this acceptance document

**No edits-in-place are allowed for frozen Governance documents.**

---

## Section E: Authority Hierarchy

This acceptance document is subordinate to:

1. **docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md** (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)
2. **docs/authority/AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY_AND_RULES_FROZEN_001.md**
3. **docs/execution/EXECUTION_BOUNDARY_001.md**

In case of conflict, DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md takes precedence.

---

## Final Acceptance Statement

**All Governance Layer documents are frozen and accepted as final.**

The Governance Layer is complete. All documents are frozen. All boundaries are established. All semantics are declared. No further changes are allowed without explicit authorization through the change boundary process.

**Governance Layer status: FROZEN**

---

**END OF GOVERNANCE IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTANCE**

**Note**: This document provides formal acceptance of all frozen Governance Layer documents. It serves as the definitive inventory and verification record for the Governance Layer freeze.
