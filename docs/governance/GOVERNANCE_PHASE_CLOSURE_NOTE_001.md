The Governance Layer is formally closed. All governance documents are created. Future reinterpretation requires a new phase.

## Governance Documents Created

The following governance documents have been created:

1. **GOVERNANCE_INTENT_STATEMENT_001.md**
   - Declares system intent in explicit negative terms
   - States what the system is not
   - Binds interpretation to structural declaration only

2. **RESPONSIBILITY_AND_NON_ATTRIBUTION_001.md**
   - Defines responsibility boundaries
   - Explicitly denies attribution of actions, decisions, outcomes, or harm to the system
   - Establishes clear separation between description and action

3. **MISUSE_AND_FORESEEABLE_MISINTERPRETATION_001.md**
   - Enumerates foreseeable ways the system could be misused or misinterpreted
   - Explicitly states that such uses are outside design intent
   - Identifies risks only (no solutions, no features)

4. **GOVERNANCE_NEVER_LIST_001.md**
   - Creates binding list of things the system will never become
   - Uses absolute and non-future-looking language
   - Defines permanent exclusions

5. **GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY_RELATION_001.md**
   - Explicitly defines how Governance relates to Authority Layer
   - States that Governance does not generate facts
   - States that Governance does not override Authority

6. **GOVERNANCE_PHASE_CLOSURE_NOTE_001.md** (this document)
   - Formally closes the Governance Layer
   - Declares that intent and responsibility framing is complete

7. **GCD_SEMANTIC_INHERITANCE_RESOLUTION_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Resolves semantic inheritance between GCD.md and frozen boundaries
   - Declares GCD execution/evolution semantics explicitly and permanently superseded
   - Establishes GCD.md as historical context only

8. **PROJECT_SCOPE_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT_001.md** (AUDIT REPORT)
   - Audits project scope alignment
   - Identifies no scope drift or boundary violations
   - Confirms all boundaries enforced

9. **GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_ACCEPTANCE_001.md** (FROZEN)
   - Provides formal acceptance of all frozen Governance documents
   - Serves as definitive inventory and verification record

10. **GOVERNANCE_CHANGE_BOUNDARY_001.md** (FROZEN)
    - Establishes change boundary for Governance Layer
    - Defines allowed and forbidden changes
    - Enforces frozen status

## Governance Layer Scope

**The Governance Layer is complete.**

The Governance Layer provides:

- Intent boundaries (what the system is not)
- Responsibility boundaries (what the system does not assume)
- Misuse identification (what uses are outside design intent)
- Never items (what the system will never become)
- Authority relation (how Governance relates to Authority)

The Governance Layer does not provide:

- New system capabilities
- Workflow definitions
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Runtime behavior
- Operational governance

**Governance is declarative, restrictive, and legally legible.**

---

## Future Reinterpretation Requires New Phase

**Future reinterpretation requires a new phase.**

The Governance Layer is closed. Changes to governance intent, responsibility boundaries, or interpretation limits require:

1. Explicit human authorization
2. New governance phase declaration
3. New versioned governance documents
4. Formal phase transition

**Normal system evolution cannot modify governance boundaries.**

---

## No Roadmap Language

**This closure note contains no roadmap language.**

This document:

- States what has been created
- References frozen documents
- Declares closure
- States future requirements

This document does not:

- Propose future enhancements
- Suggest improvements
- Indicate planned changes
- Describe evolution paths

**Closure is declarative, not forward-looking.**

---

## Authority Hierarchy

This closure note is subordinate to:

1. **docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md** (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)
2. **docs/authority/AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY_AND_RULES_FROZEN_001.md**
3. **docs/execution/EXECUTION_BOUNDARY_001.md**

In case of conflict, DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md takes precedence.
