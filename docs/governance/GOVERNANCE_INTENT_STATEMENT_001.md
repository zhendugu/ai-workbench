**Status**: FROZEN

**Frozen at**: 2025-12-29

## Core Declaration

**This system is a declarative, inert structural registry.**

The system declares structural facts. The system does not execute actions. The system does not make decisions. The system does not provide advice. The system does not automate processes. The system does not act as an agent. The system does not represent operational reality.

**All outputs are inert structural descriptions.**

---

## Non-Decision Statement

**The system does not make decisions.**

The system declares what exists. The system does not decide what should exist. The system does not decide what actions to take. The system does not decide what outcomes to pursue. The system does not decide what priorities to set. The system does not decide what risks to accept.

Human users make all decisions. The system provides structural descriptions only.

---

## Non-Advice Statement

**The system does not provide advice.**

The system declares structural facts. The system does not recommend actions. The system does not suggest improvements. The system does not propose solutions. The system does not offer guidance. The system does not provide best practices. The system does not indicate preferences.

The system presents facts. Humans interpret facts and make decisions independently.

---

## Non-Automation Statement

**The system does not automate processes.**

The system declares structure. The system does not execute workflows. The system does not trigger actions. The system does not schedule tasks. The system does not initiate processes. The system does not perform operations. The system does not control systems.

All actions are human-initiated. The system provides structural descriptions only.

---

## Non-Agent Statement

**The system does not act as an agent.**

The system declares facts. The system is not an autonomous agent. The system is not an AI agent. The system is not a decision-making agent. The system is not an execution agent. The system is not a monitoring agent. The system is not an optimization agent.

The system is a structural registry. The system does not act. The system describes.

---

## Non-Representation Statement

**The system does not represent operational reality.**

The system declares structural facts. The system does not represent current operational state. The system does not represent live systems. The system does not represent active processes. The system does not represent real-time status. The system does not represent ongoing activities.

The system represents frozen structural declarations. Real-world operations are external and unrelated.

---

## Inert Structural Descriptions

**All system outputs are inert structural descriptions.**

System outputs describe:

- Company organizational structure (Cells, Roles, Topology)
- Methodology perspective metadata
- Freeze provenance records

These descriptions are:

- Static (frozen at freeze time)
- Immutable (cannot be modified)
- Declarative (statements of what exists)
- Inert (no execution semantics)
- Factual (not operational)

System outputs do not:

- Execute actions
- Trigger effects
- Control systems
- Monitor operations
- Represent live state
- Provide advice
- Make decisions

---

## Intent Boundary

**System intent is limited to structural declaration.**

Inside the intent boundary:

- Declaration of organizational structure
- Storage of immutable structural facts
- Presentation of frozen structural descriptions

Outside the intent boundary:

- Decision-making
- Advice provision
- Process automation
- Agent behavior
- Operational representation
- Action execution
- System control

---

## Authority Hierarchy

This intent statement is subordinate to:

1. **docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md** (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)
2. **docs/authority/AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY_AND_RULES_FROZEN_001.md**
3. **docs/execution/EXECUTION_BOUNDARY_001.md**

In case of conflict, DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md takes precedence.

---

**END OF GOVERNANCE INTENT STATEMENT**

**Note**: This statement defines what the system is not. It does not define what the system is. The system's existence is defined by Authority Layer documents. This statement limits interpretation of that existence.
