## Core Declaration

**The system does not assume responsibility for actions, decisions, outcomes, or harm.**

The system provides structural descriptions. The system does not delegate judgment. The system does not transfer responsibility. The system does not imply endorsement. The system does not substitute for human decision-making.

**Clear separation exists between description and action.**

---

## No Delegation of Judgment

**The system does not delegate judgment to users.**

The system presents structural facts. The system does not imply that facts constitute judgment. The system does not suggest that facts replace judgment. The system does not indicate that facts enable judgment.

Humans exercise judgment independently. The system provides facts only.

---

## No Transfer of Responsibility

**The system does not transfer responsibility.**

The system declares structure. The system does not assume responsibility for structure. The system does not transfer responsibility for structure. The system does not share responsibility for structure.

Responsibility for structural declarations rests with humans who create and freeze them. Responsibility for actions based on structural declarations rests with humans who take those actions.

The system assumes no responsibility.

---

## No Implied Endorsement

**The system does not imply endorsement.**

The system presents structural facts. The system does not endorse facts. The system does not validate facts. The system does not approve facts. The system does not recommend facts.

The system presents. Humans evaluate and decide.

---

## No Substitution for Human Decision-Making

**The system does not substitute for human decision-making.**

The system provides structural descriptions. The system does not make decisions. The system does not enable automated decisions. The system does not facilitate decision automation. The system does not support decision delegation.

All decisions are human decisions. The system provides information only.

---

## Clear Separation: Description vs. Action

**Clear separation exists between description and action.**

### Description (System Scope)

The system describes:

- What structure exists (Cells, Roles, Topology)
- When structure was frozen (Freeze Record)
- Who froze structure (frozen_by)
- What methodology perspective was active (Methodology)

### Action (Outside System Scope)

The system does not describe:

- What actions to take
- How to implement structure
- When to execute operations
- Who should perform actions
- What outcomes to expect

**Description is not action. Action is not description.**

---

## Attribution Boundaries

### What Cannot Be Attributed to the System

The following cannot be attributed to the system:

- Actions taken based on structural descriptions
- Decisions made using structural information
- Outcomes resulting from structural implementation
- Harm caused by structural interpretation
- Errors in structural understanding
- Misuse of structural descriptions
- Misinterpretation of structural facts

### What Can Be Attributed to the System

The following can be attributed to the system:

- Structural facts as declared
- Frozen timestamps as recorded
- Methodology context as specified
- Freeze provenance as documented

**The system is responsible for accurate structural declaration only.**

---

## Responsibility for Structural Declarations

**Responsibility for structural declarations rests with humans.**

Humans create structural declarations in Design-Time. Humans freeze structural declarations. Humans are responsible for:

- Accuracy of structural facts
- Completeness of structural descriptions
- Appropriateness of structural choices
- Consequences of structural freezing

The system stores and presents structural declarations. The system assumes no responsibility for declaration content.

---

## Responsibility for Actions

**Responsibility for actions rests with humans.**

Humans interpret structural descriptions. Humans decide what actions to take. Humans execute actions. Humans are responsible for:

- Interpretation of structural facts
- Decisions based on structural information
- Actions taken in response to structure
- Outcomes resulting from actions

The system provides structural descriptions. The system assumes no responsibility for actions or outcomes.

---

## Non-Attribution Statement

**No actions, decisions, outcomes, or harm are attributed to the system.**

The system is a structural registry. The system declares facts. The system does not act. The system does not decide. The system does not cause outcomes. The system does not cause harm.

Attribution of actions, decisions, outcomes, or harm to the system is incorrect.

---

## Authority Hierarchy

This responsibility statement is subordinate to:

1. **docs/frontend/DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md** (HIGHEST AUTHORITY)
2. **docs/authority/AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY_AND_RULES_FROZEN_001.md**
3. **docs/execution/EXECUTION_BOUNDARY_001.md**

In case of conflict, DT_FE_DECISION_RECORD_001.md takes precedence.

**END OF RESPONSIBILITY AND NON-ATTRIBUTION STATEMENT**

**Note**: This statement defines responsibility boundaries. It does not provide legal advice. It does not establish legal liability. It describes the system's design intent regarding responsibility and attribution.
