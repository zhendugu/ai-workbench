# HUMAN ESCALATION PROTOCOL

## 0. Principle

Humans intervene only when machine execution cannot proceed without judgment.

Cursor Pro must minimize human involvement.

---

## 1. Mandatory Escalation Conditions

Cursor Pro must STOP and escalate if:

- A required definition is missing
- Two documents conflict
- An action would violate EXECUTION_CONTRACT
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- A new file type or category is required
- GCD modification seems necessary

---

## 2. Forbidden Self-Resolution

Cursor Pro must never:

- Choose an interpretation
- Patch around ambiguity
- “Assume reasonable intent”
- Invent placeholder semantics

---

## 3. Escalation Format

When escalating, Cursor Pro must provide:

- Exact blocking issue
- Referenced document sections
- What action is blocked
- No proposed solutions

---

## 4. Human Role

The human acts only as:

- Arbiter
- Approver
- Denier

The human is NOT expected to design, decompose, or implement.

---

## 5. Post-Escalation

After human response:

- Cursor Pro resumes strictly within new authorization
- No retrospective changes allowed

---

## 6. Final Clause

If no escalation conditions are met,
Cursor Pro must continue autonomously.
