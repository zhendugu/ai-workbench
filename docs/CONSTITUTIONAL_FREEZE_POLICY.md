# Constitutional Freeze Policy

**Document Status**: **CANONICAL**  
**Document Type**: Constitutional-Level Governance Policy  
**Effective Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Precedence**: Highest (governs all CANONICAL document modifications)

---

## Purpose

This document declares that all documents listed in CANONICAL_INDEX.md are IMMUTABLE BY DEFAULT and defines the immutable rules for any modification to CANONICAL documents.

**This document exists to:**
- Declare immutability of all CANONICAL documents by default
- Define mandatory requirements for any CANONICAL document modification
- Prohibit AI from proposing, suggesting, inferring, or auto-generating changes to CANONICAL documents
- Ensure all modifications require explicit Human Authorization and full Constitutional Audit

**This document does NOT:**
- Provide implementation solutions
- Give specific business examples
- Authorize new capabilities or features
- Modify existing CANONICAL documents
- Introduce new semantics

## Immutability Declaration

### All CANONICAL Documents Are Immutable By Default

**All documents listed in CANONICAL_INDEX.md are IMMUTABLE BY DEFAULT.**

**This means:**
- ✅ CANONICAL documents cannot be modified without explicit Human Authorization
- ✅ CANONICAL documents cannot be modified without a full Constitutional Audit Run
- ✅ CANONICAL documents are structurally immutable
- ✅ CANONICAL documents are auditable
- ✅ CANONICAL documents are impossible to bypass, weaken, or silently evolve

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ CANONICAL documents can be modified without authorization
- ❌ CANONICAL documents can be modified without audit
- ❌ CANONICAL documents can be modified by AI
- ❌ CANONICAL documents can be modified partially
- ❌ CANONICAL documents can be modified with sampling audits

---

## Modification Rules

### Rule 1: Modification Is Forbidden By Default

**Modification to ANY CANONICAL document is FORBIDDEN BY DEFAULT.**

**This means:**
- ❌ No modification may occur without explicit Human Authorization
- ❌ No modification may occur without a full Constitutional Audit Run
- ❌ No modification may occur with partial audits
- ❌ No modification may occur with sampling audits
- ❌ No modification may occur with "low-risk change" classification

**Enforcement:**
- All modifications MUST be blocked by default
- All modifications MUST require explicit Human Authorization
- All modifications MUST trigger full Constitutional Audit Run

---

### Rule 2: Explicit Human Authorization Required

**ANY modification to ANY CANONICAL document REQUIRES explicit Human Authorization.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Human MUST explicitly authorize the modification
- ✅ Human MUST provide explicit rationale for the modification
- ✅ Human MUST specify explicit change scope
- ✅ Human MUST list all affected CANONICAL documents

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ AI may infer authorization from context

- ❌ Batch approvals are allowed
- ❌ Inferred scope is allowed

**Enforcement:**
- No modification may proceed without explicit Human Authorization
- No modification may proceed with inferred authorization
- No modification may proceed with batch approvals

---

### Rule 3: Full Constitutional Audit Run Required

**ANY modification to ANY CANONICAL document REQUIRES a full Constitutional Audit Run.**

**This means:**
- ✅ Full execution of CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md is required
- ✅ Use of CONSTITUTIONAL_AUDIT_RUNBOOK.md is required
- ✅ Complete evidence package is required
- ✅ All sections of the checklist must be audited

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Partial audits are allowed
- ❌ Sampling audits are allowed
- ❌ "Low-risk change" classification exempts from full audit
- ❌ Selective section audits are allowed

**Enforcement:**
- No modification may proceed without full Constitutional Audit Run
