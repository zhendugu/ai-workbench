**This document exists to:**
- Require full Constitutional Audit Run for any CANONICAL document change
- Prohibit partial audits for CANONICAL document changes
- Prohibit sampling audits for CANONICAL document changes
- Prohibit "low-risk change" classification for CANONICAL document changes

**This document does NOT:**
- Provide implementation solutions
- Give specific business examples
- Authorize new capabilities or features
- Modify existing CANONICAL documents
- Introduce new semantics

## Core Rule

### ANY Change to ANY CANONICAL Document Triggers Full Audit

**ANY change to ANY CANONICAL document REQUIRES full execution of CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md and use of CONSTITUTIONAL_AUDIT_RUNBOOK.md.**

**This means:**

- ✅ Complete evidence package is required
- ✅ All sections of the checklist must be audited

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Partial audits are allowed
- ❌ Sampling audits are allowed
- ❌ "Low-risk change" classification exempts from full audit
- ❌ Selective section audits are allowed

**Enforcement:**
- No modification may proceed without full Constitutional Audit Run
- No modification may proceed with partial audits
- No modification may proceed with sampling audits

---

## Rule 1: Full Execution of CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md Required

- ✅ All check items must be recorded as PASS or FAIL

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Partial section audits are allowed
- ❌ Selective check item audits are allowed

- ✅ All audit trigger conditions must be checked
- ✅ All audit scope selection rules must be followed
- ✅ All PASS/FAIL recording rules must be followed
- ✅ All remediation procedures must be followed

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Partial runbook execution is allowed
- ❌ Selective runbook steps are allowed
- ❌ Skipping runbook steps is allowed
- ❌ "Low-risk change" classification exempts from runbook execution

**Enforcement:**
- No modification may proceed without runbook execution
- No modification may proceed with partial runbook execution
- No modification may proceed with selective runbook execution
