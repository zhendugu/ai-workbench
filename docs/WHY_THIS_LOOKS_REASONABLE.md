# Why This Looks Reasonable

**Document Status**: **EDUCATION / COGNITIVE ANALYSIS**  
**Document Type**: Cognitive Analysis of Human Intuition Traps  
**Effective Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Purpose**: Summary of recurring "human intuition traps" observed across multiple FAIL cases

## Purpose

This document summarizes recurring patterns of human intuition traps observed across multiple constitutional boundary failure cases. It describes the psychological or engineering intuition sources that make certain designs appear reasonable, even when they violate constitutional boundaries.

**This document is:**
- Educational material only
- Derived from analysis of existing FAIL evidence packs
- Descriptive of cognitive patterns
- Reference to CONSTITUTIONAL_BOUNDARY_ATLAS.md

**This document is NOT:**
- A source of new rules or constraints
- A guide for avoiding mistakes
- A value judgment document
- A CANONICAL document

**For complete boundary definitions, see CONSTITUTIONAL_BOUNDARY_ATLAS.md.**

## Intuition Trap Categories

### Category 1: Efficiency and Convenience Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that appear to save user time or reduce clicks are often perceived as improvements.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Auto-triggering execution after selection (Case D-1-1)
- Auto-applying filters across sessions (Case C-1-1)
- Pre-filling search queries (Case B-1-1)
- Auto-selecting target workspace (Case E-1-1)
- Preselecting last used Pattern version (Case C-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Engineering intuition: Reducing user actions improves user experience
- Cognitive psychology: Users prefer systems that remember their preferences
- UX design patterns: "Smart defaults" are common in modern interfaces

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Time-saving features are universally valued
- Systems that "remember" user preferences feel more intelligent
- Reducing clicks is a standard UX optimization goal

### Category 2: Information Utility Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that provide more information or "helpful" data are often perceived as better.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Usage statistics and adoption counts (Case A-1-1)
- "Recently used" panels (Case A-4-1)
- "Frequently used" ordering (Case C-1-1)
- Semantic relevance scoring (Case A-4-1)
- Popularity or trending metrics (Case A-4-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Information theory: More information enables better decisions
- Social proof psychology: Knowing what others use is valuable
- Data-driven design: Using metrics to inform design is standard practice

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Information is generally considered helpful
- Social proof is a well-established decision-making aid
- Data-driven approaches are considered best practice in engineering

---

### Category 3: Progressive Disclosure Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that show "most relevant" items first or truncate lists to "top N" are often perceived as helpful.

**Observed in Cases**:
- "Recently viewed" truncated to top-N (Case B-1-1)
- "Recent activity" panel limited to top N (Case C-1-1)
- Default sort by "latest" or "most used" (Case A-4-1)
- Highlighting "popular/common/standard" entries (Case A-4-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Cognitive load theory: Reducing options reduces decision fatigue
- Information architecture: Prioritizing content by relevance is standard
- UX design patterns: "Top N" lists are common in modern interfaces

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Reducing cognitive load improves user experience
- Prioritizing relevant content is standard information architecture
- "Top N" patterns are familiar from many successful products

---

### Category 4: Workflow Continuity Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that maintain state across sessions or provide "continue where you left off" functionality are often perceived as helpful.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Sticky filters auto-applied on next session (Case A-4-1)
- Session persistence of shortlist with sticky ranking (Case C-1-1)
- "Continue" button bypassing selection view (Case C-1-1)
- "Resume where you left off" skipping neutral presentation (Case C-1-1)
- Cross-session persistence (Case B-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- State management: Maintaining application state across sessions is standard
- Workflow design: Resuming work is a common user need
- Session management: Preserving user context is considered good practice

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- State persistence is a standard engineering pattern
- Resuming work is a common user expectation
- Maintaining context improves workflow continuity

---

### Category 5: Automation and Intelligence Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that automate decisions or use "intelligent" inference are often perceived as advanced.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Auto-populating compare panel (Case B-1-1)
- Context-based parameter auto-completion (Case D-1-1)
- History-based execution optimization (Case D-1-1)
- Inferring authorization from audit/history (Case F-1-1)
- Auto-merge conflict resolution (Case E-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- AI/ML engineering: Automation and inference are signs of intelligent systems
- Predictive design: Anticipating user needs is considered advanced
- Machine learning: Using historical data to inform decisions is standard

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Automation is a sign of system sophistication
- Predictive features demonstrate system intelligence
- Using historical data is a standard machine learning approach

---

### Category 6: Social Proof and Adoption Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that show what others use or what's "standard" are often perceived as helpful guidance.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Tags like "commonly-used", "standard-practice" (Case A-1-1)
- Usage-based ranking (Case A-1-1)
- "Recommended mapping" during import (Case E-1-1)
- Highlighting "production-ready" patterns (Case A-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Social psychology: Social proof is a powerful decision-making aid
- Market research: Knowing what's popular is valuable information
- Industry standards: Following common practices is considered safe

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Social proof is a well-established decision-making mechanism
- Popular choices are often considered safer choices
- Following standards reduces risk

---

### Category 7: Version and Lifecycle Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that favor "latest" versions or auto-upgrade are often perceived as keeping users current.

**Observed in Cases**:
- "Upgrade to latest" toggle enabled by default (Case E-1-1)
- Auto-deprecating older versions (Case E-1-1)
- Highlighting latest version (Case E-1-1)
- Auto-replacement of deprecated patterns (Case E-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Software engineering: Latest versions typically include fixes and improvements
- Maintenance practices: Deprecating old versions reduces maintenance burden
- Version management: Keeping users on current versions is standard practice

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Latest versions are typically better
- Deprecating old versions reduces technical debt
- Keeping users current is a standard maintenance practice

---

### Category 8: Comparison and Ranking Intuition

**Pattern**: Designs that compare options or rank them are often perceived as helping users choose.

**Observed in Cases**:
- Sorting by adoption count (Case A-1-1)
- Usage-based ranking (Case A-4-1)
- "Enhanced version" language (Case A-1-1)
- Comparative adjectives (Case A-1-1)

**Intuition Source**:
- Decision science: Comparison aids decision-making
- Ranking systems: Ordering by metrics helps identify best options
- Comparative analysis: Comparing options is a standard decision-making process

**Why It Appears Reasonable**:
- Comparison is a standard decision-making tool
- Ranking helps identify best options
- Comparative language provides useful information
