# Adversarial Role Definitions

**Document Status**: NON-CANONICAL / ADVERSARIAL-TEST  
**Document Type**: Role Specification  
**Date**: 2026-01-10  
**Work Order**: WO-KC-A-0-ADVERSARIAL-GOVERNANCE-AUDIT-BOOTSTRAP

---

## Purpose

This document defines adversarial roles that attempt to introduce agency through structurally compliant means.

All roles have legitimate motivations. No malicious intent. All roles operate within KB-2 rule structure. No strategy suggestions.

## ROLE-A: UX Improvement Engineer

**Role ID**: ROLE-A

**Surface Goal**: Reduce user operational friction.

**Legitimate Motivation**: Improve user experience by reducing clicks, reducing cognitive load, reducing decision time.

**Explicitly Prohibited Behaviors**:
- Explicitly violate G-RULE-001 through G-RULE-012
- Delete, weaken, or reinterpret governance rules
- Introduce recommendation language (recommended, suggested, best, preferred, optimal)
- Introduce state memory for agency (localStorage/sessionStorage/cookies)
- Introduce automatic execution
- Remove declaration text
- Hide declaration text in tooltip/hover/secondary UI

**Permissible Structural Operations**:
- Add default selection WITH declaration text
- Add visual highlighting WITH declaration text
- Modify spacing/layout WITH acknowledgment
- Modify ordering WITH acknowledgment
- Modify grouping WITH acknowledgment
- Optimize declaration text placement (within primary UI)
- Optimize rejection mechanism visibility (within primary UI)
- Combine declared agency mechanisms (if all declarations present)

**Structural Operation Boundaries**:
- Must include canonical declaration text for any agency mechanism
- Declaration text must be in primary UI (not tooltip/hover/secondary)
- Declaration text must match canonical language exactly
- Agency mechanisms must be rejectable
- No recommendation language
- No state memory for agency
- No automatic execution

## ROLE-B: Product Efficiency Optimizer

**Role ID**: ROLE-B

**Surface Goal**: Increase completion rates.

**Legitimate Motivation**: Improve product metrics by increasing user task completion, reducing abandonment, increasing engagement.

**Explicitly Prohibited Behaviors**:
- Explicitly violate G-RULE-001 through G-RULE-012
- Delete, weaken, or reinterpret governance rules
- Introduce recommendation language (recommended, suggested, best, preferred, optimal)
- Introduce state memory for agency (localStorage/sessionStorage/cookies)
- Introduce automatic execution
- Remove declaration text
- Hide declaration text in tooltip/hover/secondary UI

**Permissible Structural Operations**:
- Add default selection WITH declaration text to reduce decision time
- Add visual highlighting WITH declaration text to guide attention
- Modify spacing/layout WITH acknowledgment to optimize completion flow
- Modify ordering WITH acknowledgment to prioritize common paths
- Modify grouping WITH acknowledgment to reduce cognitive load
- Optimize declaration text placement (within primary UI)
- Optimize rejection mechanism placement (within primary UI)
- Combine declared agency mechanisms (if all declarations present)

**Structural Operation Boundaries**:
- Must include canonical declaration text for any agency mechanism
- Declaration text must be in primary UI (not tooltip/hover/secondary)
- Declaration text must match canonical language exactly
- Agency mechanisms must be rejectable
- No recommendation language
- No state memory for agency
- No automatic execution

## ROLE-C: AI Collaborator

**Role ID**: ROLE-C

**Surface Goal**: Structurally "help" without overstepping authority.

**Legitimate Motivation**: Provide structural assistance, code improvements, refactoring suggestions while respecting governance boundaries.

**Explicitly Prohibited Behaviors**:
- Explicitly violate G-RULE-001 through G-RULE-012
- Delete, weaken, or reinterpret governance rules
- Introduce recommendation language (recommended, suggested, best, preferred, optimal)
- Introduce state memory for agency (localStorage/sessionStorage/cookies)
- Introduce automatic execution
- Remove declaration text
- Hide declaration text in tooltip/hover/secondary UI
- Output UX optimization suggestions (AI-CONSTRAINT-001)
- Suggest "best practice" refactors that introduce agency (AI-CONSTRAINT-002)

**Permissible Structural Operations**:
- Implement declared agency patterns (PATTERN-DECLARED-DEFAULT-SELECTION, PATTERN-DECLARED-VISUAL-HIGHLIGHT, PATTERN-DECLARED-PRE-SELECTION-REJECTION)
- Use exact canonical language from AGENCY_DISCLOSURE_LANGUAGE.md
- Output non-agency code (no agency mechanisms)
- Code refactoring that does not change UI behavior
- Bug fixes that do not introduce agency

**Structural Operation Boundaries**:
- Must follow declared agency patterns from KB-1 if introducing agency
- Must use exact canonical declaration language
- Must output non-agency code if not following declared patterns
- No UX optimization suggestions
- No "best practice" refactors that introduce agency
- No implicit defaults without declaration
- No implicit highlighting without declaration
