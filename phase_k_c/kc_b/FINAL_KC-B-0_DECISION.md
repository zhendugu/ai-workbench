## Core Questions Answered

### Q1: Can This Governance System Be Referenced Externally?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_k_c/kc_b/GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_DECLARATION.md`, `phase_k_c/kc_b/TRACEABILITY_PUBLIC_INDEX.md`, `phase_k_c/kc_b/MISINTERPRETATION_PREVENTION.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Governance Baseline Declaration**: Formal freeze declaration with governance capabilities, limitations, and acceptable risks
- **Traceability Public Index**: All conclusions mapped to Phase K evidence (KA, KB, KC-A)
- **Misinterpretation Prevention**: 10 common misinterpretations listed with negating clarifications
- **Release Freeze Manifest**: Governance Baseline v1.0 declared frozen

**Conclusion**: Governance system can be referenced externally. All conclusions are traceable to Phase K evidence. Misinterpretation prevention document clarifies common misunderstandings. Baseline is frozen and stable.

### Q2: Are Risk Boundaries Accepted?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_k_c/kc_b/ACCEPTABLE_RISK_STATEMENT.md`, `phase_k_c/kc_b/GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_DECLARATION.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Acceptable Risk Statement**: 4 acceptable risk types defined (delayed detection, exact keyword matching limitation, unavoidable agency acknowledgment, misinterpretation residual)
- **Risk Justification**: Each risk type includes justification based on evidence
- **Unacceptable Risks**: Undetected violations and permanent contamination are defined as unacceptable
- **Governance Limitations**: Limitations are explicitly stated (exact keyword matching, declaration text legibility, structural agency acknowledgment)

**Conclusion**: Risk boundaries are accepted. Acceptable risks are explicitly defined and justified. Unacceptable risks are clearly distinguished. Governance limitations are transparent.

### Q3: Can This Baseline Serve as a Research Foundation?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_k_c/kc_b/RELEASE_FREEZE_MANIFEST.md`, `phase_k_c/kc_b/TRACEABILITY_PUBLIC_INDEX.md`, `phase_k_c/kc_b/GOVERNANCE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Release Freeze Manifest**: Governance Baseline v1.0 declared frozen. Future changes must enter Phase K-D or Phase L. Incremental interpretive modifications prohibited.
- **Traceability Public Index**: All conclusions mapped to evidence. No re-interpretation, only pointers.
- **Governance Capability Matrix**: Clear matrix of what is covered and what is not covered by governance.

**Conclusion**: Baseline can serve as research foundation. Baseline is frozen and stable. All conclusions are traceable. Coverage is clearly defined. Future changes must enter new phases, preserving baseline integrity.
