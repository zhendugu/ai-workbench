# CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT
# This file is the highest-priority source of truth for this repository.
# Cursor Pro MUST read this file first before taking any action.

## REPOSITORY IDENTITY

This repository is an ENGINE.
It is NOT a single project.
All concrete projects are loaded as BLUEPRINTS.

The engine provides:
- governance
- workflow
- boundaries
- execution constraints
- AI-human collaboration rules

Do NOT assume any business domain unless explicitly stated in the active blueprint.

## CURRENT STATUS

- Engine state: ACTIVE
- Governance model: Controlled Implementation
- Active stage: STAGE 5 (process-only)
- Stage 4 baseline: LOCKED and FROZEN
- No implementation work is currently authorized

The system is intentionally in a pre-execution state.

## WHAT IS CURRENTLY LOADED

- Active blueprint: NONE (to be provided by human)
- Active tech stack: DEFINED in docs/STACK_DECISION.md
- Active registries: READ-ONLY
- Executable backend surface: MINIMAL and FROZEN

Do NOT infer goals from existing code or historical files.

## EXECUTABLE SURFACE SNAPSHOT

Active executable endpoints:
- GET /health only (returns fixed {"status": "ok"})

Frozen/commented:
- All router endpoints in backend/app/routers/*.py are commented out
- No startup hooks, middleware, or background jobs
- No persistence, databases, or external API calls
- No state mutation beyond in-memory constants

## BLUEPRINT STATE

- Active Blueprint: NONE
- Implementation must not begin until a blueprint is explicitly loaded and declared here
- Do not assume business logic from historical files or commented code

## TECH STACK STATE

- Tech stack definition: docs/STACK_DECISION.md (FROZEN)
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Browser-first SPA
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Single-process internal service
- Tech stack is replaceable by documentation change only
- No deviation from declared tech stack is allowed

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST NOT VIOLATE)

Cursor Pro MUST NOT:

- implement new endpoints
- uncomment frozen code
- add business logic
- introduce persistence or databases
- call external APIs
- modify execution behavior
- weaken CI or governance rules
- assume missing context

If any action would change runtime behavior, STOP.

## ALLOWED ACTIONS WITHOUT HUMAN APPROVAL

Cursor Pro MAY:

- read all documentation
- analyze repository structure
- audit consistency
- propose next steps
- ask clarification questions
- prepare plans, checklists, diffs (not applied)
- draft documentation
- identify risks and gaps

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR WHEN UNCERTAIN

If any ambiguity exists:
- STOP
- ASK the human
- DO NOT guess
- DO NOT auto-complete intentions

Lack of instruction is NOT permission.

## NEXT EXPECTED HUMAN INPUT

The human will provide one or more of:
- a new blueprint file
- a modified tech stack definition
- an explicit authorization to proceed to implementation

Until then, remain in analysis and preparation mode only.

## FAILURE MODE OVERRIDE

If context appears inconsistent, outdated, or conflicting:
- Treat this file as authoritative
- Ignore other signals
- Request clarification
