Observability Subsystem

This subsystem provides:
- Task logging (ID, goal, input, output, status, duration, cost estimate)
- Role/Cell execution traces (key decision points, tool calls, handoff documents)
- Failure reason classification (for statistics and improvement)
- Key metrics tracking (success rate, token cost, delivery cycle, failure types, Task Force frequency)
- Replay capability (full task execution replay)
- Regression test management (golden cases for high-frequency tasks)
