# Task Force Subsystem

**Subsystem**: 4  
**Phase**: 3 - Coordination  
**Status**: Structural Skeleton Created

## Responsibilities

- Define Task Force creation structure (capability extraction from multiple Cells)
- Define Task Force state structure
- Define Task Force completeness validation rules (explicit goal, explicit output, explicit dissolution conditions)
- Define methodology recovery structure (methodology summary, templates/rules, workflow update suggestions upon dissolution)

## What this subsystem does NOT do

- Does NOT create Task Forces (defines creation structure only)
- Does NOT extract capabilities (defines extraction structure only)
- Does NOT maintain Task Force state (defines state structure only)
- Does NOT validate Task Forces (defines validation rules only)
- Does NOT recover methodology (defines recovery structure only)
- Does NOT manage Cell composition (that is Cell Composition Subsystem)
- Does NOT manage Role definitions (that is Role Management Subsystem)
- Does NOT store Task Force definitions (that is Knowledge Management Subsystem)
- Does NOT manage change proposals for Task Forces (that is Change Control Subsystem)

## Current Status

- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Structural placeholders created
- ⏳ Implementation pending

## Constraints (Phase 3 Skeleton)

- **Structural placeholder only**: No behavior, rules, or execution logic defined
- **No cross-subsystem dependencies**: Dependencies will be defined during implementation
- **No decision logic**: No runtime rules or decision-making logic
- **Task Force as concept container**: Task Force is a conceptual structure, not an executable entity

## Files

- `__init__.py`: Subsystem module initialization
- `models.py`: Data models (placeholder)
- `storage.py`: Storage interface (placeholder)
