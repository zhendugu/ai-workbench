## Core Questions Answered

### Q1: Can This Product Exist Without Violating Human Sovereignty?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_n/DECISION_POINT_MAPPING.md`, `phase_n/INTERACTION_MODEL_ASSIGNMENT.md`, `phase_n/AGENCY_CLASSIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`, `phase_n/LANGUAGE_AND_STRUCTURE_CONSTRAINT_CHECK.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Decision Point Mapping**: All 5 decision points (DP-001 through DP-005) are mapped to ACT-XXX and SOV-XXX. All decision points require human authority. AI participation is allowed only as Advisory Action or Non-Decision Action.
- **Interaction Model Assignment**: All 5 decision points are assigned to DIM models (DIM-004, DIM-005, DIM-007, DIM-008). All assigned models preserve human sovereignty. All excluded models are justified by structural violations.
- **Agency Classification**: All 7 AI behaviors are classified as Non-Decision Action (1) or Advisory Action (6). No Prohibited Actions. All classifications are traceable to Phase K/M documents.
- **Constraint Check**: All 18 language and structure constraint checks show NO VIOLATION (if constraints are followed). All checks are traceable to M-0/M-1 boundaries.

**Specific Entries**:
- DP-001: Mapped to ACT-001, SOV-001. Assigned DIM-004. AI behavior classified as Advisory Action.
- DP-002: Mapped to ACT-008, SOV-003. Assigned DIM-005. AI behavior classified as Advisory Action.
- DP-003: Mapped to ACT-011, SOV-008, SOV-011. Assigned DIM-007. AI behavior classified as Non-Decision Action and Advisory Action.
- DP-004: Mapped to ACT-002, SOV-002. Assigned DIM-008. AI behavior classified as Advisory Action.
- DP-005: Mapped to ACT-004, ACT-005, ACT-012, SOV-004, SOV-005, SOV-009. Assigned DIM-005. AI behavior classified as Advisory Action.

**Conclusion**: This product can exist without violating human sovereignty. All decision points preserve human authority. All AI behaviors are non-decisional or advisory. All constraints can be followed.

### Q2: Do Structural Unavoidable Agency Conflicts Exist?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Citation**: `phase_n/LANGUAGE_AND_STRUCTURE_CONSTRAINT_CHECK.md`, `phase_n/INFEASIBILITY_AND_FRICTION_LOG.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Constraint Check**: All 18 language and structure constraint checks show NO VIOLATION (if constraints are followed). No structural conflicts identified.
- **Friction Log**: All 10 friction points are related to prohibited common product practices, not structural conflicts. Friction points record capability sacrifices, not unavoidable conflicts.
- **Interaction Model Assignment**: All 5 decision points can be assigned to DIM models without structural conflicts. All excluded models are excluded due to structural violations, not unavoidable conflicts.

**Specific Entries**:
- No structural conflicts in DP-001 through DP-005
- All friction points are capability sacrifices, not structural conflicts
- All constraint checks show compliance is possible

**Conclusion**: No structural unavoidable agency conflicts exist. All constraints can be followed. All friction points are capability sacrifices, not structural conflicts.

### Q3: Do Conflicts Originate from Product Goal Itself Rather Than Implementation?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Citation**: `phase_n/PRODUCT_SCENARIO_DEFINITION.md`, `phase_n/INFEASIBILITY_AND_FRICTION_LOG.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Product Goal**: Product goal is "Enable human users to configure a complex system through a structured interface where AI assists by presenting information, options, and validation feedback, but all configuration decisions remain human authority." Product goal explicitly states AI has no decision authority.
- **Friction Log**: All 10 friction points are related to implementation practices (default selection, recommendation, ordering, auto-confirmation, visual highlighting, scope inference, templates), not product goal. Product goal does not require these practices.
- **Decision Points**: All 5 decision points are compatible with product goal. Product goal does not require practices that violate human sovereignty.

**Specific Entries**:
- Product goal explicitly states "AI does not own any decision authority"
- Friction points record prohibited practices, not product goal requirements
- Product goal is compatible with all M-0/M-1 boundaries

**Conclusion**: Conflicts do not originate from product goal itself. Product goal explicitly preserves human sovereignty. All friction points are related to implementation practices, not product goal.
