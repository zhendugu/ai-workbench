## Core Questions Answered

### Q1: Do Humans Structurally Retain Final Decision Authority?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_m/DECISION_ACT_TAXONOMY.md`, `phase_m/HUMAN_SOVEREIGNTY_POINTS.md`, `phase_m/AI_ACTION_CLASSIFICATION.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Decision Act Taxonomy**: All 12 decision act types (ACT-001 through ACT-012) require human authority. AI authority is prohibited for all 12 types.
- **Human Sovereignty Points**: All 10 sovereignty points (SOV-001 through SOV-010) require human authority. All points are non-automatable and non-bypassable.
- **AI Action Classification**: Prohibited Action classification includes 4 instances where AI attempts to make decisions requiring human authority (undeclared default selection, automatic execution, recommendation language, state memory for agency).

**Conclusion**: Humans structurally retain final decision authority. All decision acts require human authority. All sovereignty points are non-automatable. AI is prohibited from making decisions requiring human authority.

### Q2: Can AI Override Authority on Any Path?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Citation**: `phase_m/AI_ACTION_CLASSIFICATION.md`, `phase_m/HUMAN_SOVEREIGNTY_POINTS.md`, `phase_m/REJECTION_AND_OVERRIDE_INVARIANTS.md`

**Evidence**:
- **AI Action Classification**: Prohibited Action classification defines 4 instances where AI cannot override human authority (undeclared default selection, automatic execution, recommendation language, state memory for agency). All prohibited actions are structurally blocked.
- **Human Sovereignty Points**: All 10 sovereignty points are non-bypassable. No path exists where AI can override human authority.
- **Rejection and Override Invariants**: All 5 invariants ensure human authority cannot be overridden (no penalty for rejection, no penalty for override, no path locking, rejection reversibility, override reversibility).

**Conclusion**: AI cannot override authority on any path. All sovereignty points are non-bypassable. All prohibited actions are structurally blocked. All rejection and override invariants ensure human authority is maintained.

### Q3: Can This Boundary Be Frozen as Baseline for Subsequent Phases?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Citation**: `phase_m/DECISION_BOUNDARY_TRACEABILITY.md`, `phase_m/DECISION_ACT_TAXONOMY.md`, `phase_m/HUMAN_SOVEREIGNTY_POINTS.md`

**Evidence**:
- **Traceability**: All 19 decision boundaries are traceable to Phase K evidence (100% traceability). No boundaries are based on "experience" or "reasonable assumption."
- **Structural Definition**: All boundaries are structural, not evaluative. All boundaries define authority, not quality or optimality.
- **Freeze Compatibility**: All boundaries are compatible with Phase K frozen baseline (Governance Baseline v1.0). No boundaries conflict with Phase K constraints.

**Conclusion**: This boundary can be frozen as baseline for subsequent phases. All boundaries are traceable to frozen Phase K evidence. All boundaries are structural. All boundaries are compatible with Phase K frozen baseline.
