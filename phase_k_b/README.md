# Phase K-B: Agency Governance & Design Boundary Phase

**Phase Status**: IN_PROGRESS  
**Phase Type**: Synthesis & Boundary Definition  
**Previous Phase**: Phase K-A (Single Variable Injection Experiments)

---

## Purpose

Phase K-B synthesizes empirical findings from Phase K-A experiments (KA-1 through KA-5) into explicit, enforceable agency boundaries. This phase converts experimental results into actionable design constraints, classifications, and decision rules.

---

## Scope

- Input: Phase K-A experiment results (KA-1 through KA-5)
- Output: Agency boundary model, design constraints, classifications
- Type: Analytical, normative, architectural
- No UI implementation
- No code changes
- No new experiments

---

## Work Orders

- **WO-KB-0**: Agency Boundary Synthesis (current)
- **WO-KB-1**: Declared Agency Pattern Design (pending KB-0 completion)

---

## Documents

Documents created in this phase are marked as **NON-CANONICAL** and **DESIGN-BOUNDARY**.
