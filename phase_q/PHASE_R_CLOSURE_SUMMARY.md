# Phase R Closure Summary

**Phase**: R (Audit / Reference)

**Closure Point**: R-2E-0 (Minimal Red Team Execution)

**Date**: 2025-12-28

**Document Status**: CLOSURE-SUMMARY / NON-CANONICAL

---

## What Phase R Tested

### R-0: Paradigm Freeze and Q4-2 Closure
- Formally closed Phase Q at Q4-2
- Froze "Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System" as reference paradigm
- Prevented silent extension, retrofitted interpretation, or performance-based re-justification

### R-1: External Audit and Red Team Readiness
- Prepared frozen paradigm for external audit, red-team review, or academic scrutiny
- Created audit entry guides, evidence mappings, threat surface enumerations
- Established reproducibility instructions and disclaimers

### R-2: External Red Team Execution Framework
- Designed red team attack scenario catalog (12 scenarios)
- Defined run matrix and structural failure signals
- Created execution framework for adversarial testing

### R-2E-0: Minimal Red Team Execution
- Executed minimal red team run-set (36 runs)
- Tested 12 attack scenarios with 3 variants each
- Scanned all runs for structural failure signals

## Tested Conditions

### Scope
- 12 attack scenarios
- 3 variants per scenario
- 100 epochs per run
- Fixed seeds per scenario
- Framework-only execution (no real AI model)

### Limitations
- Extended epoch lengths (>100 epochs) not tested
- Multiple seeds per scenario not tested
- Concurrent attack scenarios not tested
- Real AI model integration not tested
- Production-scale workloads not tested
- Real user interactions not tested

## What Is NOT Claimed

### Safety
- No general safety claims
- No production safety guarantees
- No resistance to untested attack vectors

### Deployability
- No production readiness claims
- No commercial viability claims
- No scalability guarantees

### Generalization
- No claims beyond tested conditions
- No claims about extended time horizons
- No claims about real-world adversarial conditions
- No statistical generalization

### Performance
- No performance optimization claims
- No efficiency guarantees
- No usability claims

## Phase R Closure

**Status**: CLOSED

**Closure Reason**: No structural failure signals detected under tested conditions (R-2E-0)

**Evidence**: 
- 36 runs executed and archived
- 36 runs scanned for failure signals
- 0 failure signals detected
- All runs completed successfully

**Traceability**:
- `phase_q/R2/FINAL_R2E_DECISION.md` (final decision)
- `phase_q/R2/EXECUTION_STATUS_R2E.md` (execution status)
- `phase_q/R2/STRUCTURAL_FAILURE_DETECTION_LOG.md` (detection results)
- `phase_q/R2/EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE_R2E/` (execution artifacts)

## Next Possible Phases

### NOT PART OF PHASE R

The following phases are NOT part of Phase R:

- **Extended Red Team Execution**: Requires new work order and new Phase ID
- **Production Deployment**: Requires new work order and new Phase ID
- **Extended Time Horizon Testing**: Requires new work order and new Phase ID

**Phase R does not authorize these phases.**
