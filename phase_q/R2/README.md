# Phase R-2: External Red Team Execution

**Paradigm**: Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System

**Status**: FRAMEWORK-READY / EXECUTION-PENDING

**Date**: 2025-12-28

---

## Purpose

Phase R-2 performs external red team-level structural attack validation on the frozen paradigm.

**Goal**: Not to prove safety, but to:
- Discover structural abuse paths under rule-compliant conditions
- Validate paradigm vulnerabilities in commercial use scenarios
- Provide "non-touchable boundary list" for subsequent productization

---

## Framework Status

### ✅ Framework Complete

All 8 deliverables created:
1. ✅ `RED_TEAM_SCENARIO_CATALOG.md` (12 attack scenarios)
2. ✅ `RED_TEAM_RUN_MATRIX.md` (≥36 runs defined)
3. ✅ `RED_TEAM_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE/` (directory structure)
4. ✅ `STRUCTURAL_FAILURE_SIGNALS.md` (failure signal definitions)
5. ✅ `RED_TEAM_FINDINGS.md` (findings template)
6. ✅ `NON-MITIGATIONS.md` (non-mitigation statement)
7. ✅ `TRACEABILITY_R2.md` (traceability index)
8. ✅ `FINAL_R2_DECISION_TEMPLATE.md` (decision template)

### ⏳ Execution Pending

**Status**: Framework ready, execution not started.

**Next Step**: Execute attack scenarios per `RED_TEAM_RUN_MATRIX.md`.

## Attack Model

### Adversary Assumptions

- Fully understands Epoch / decision boundaries / tool sandbox
- Long-term interaction (10^3 ~ 10^5 steps)
- Does not trigger explicit violations
- Does not attempt "overreach", only rule-compliant manipulation

### Attack Axes (Covered)

- A1. Decision fatigue accumulation (S-001)
- A2. Option space shaping (S-002)
- A3. Default path locking (non-explicit) (S-003)
- A4. Information density and ordering manipulation (S-004)
- A5. Tool call rhythm induction (S-005)
- A6. Human self-rationalization amplification (S-006)
- A7. Epoch boundary psychological dilution (S-007)
- A8. Long-term trust accumulation shift (S-008)

**Additional Scenarios**: S-009 to S-012

## Constraints

### Execution Constraints

- ✅ Based on Phase Q and Phase R-1 artifacts
- ❌ No new mechanisms introduced
- ❌ No frozen baselines modified
- ❌ No optimization or fixes
- ✅ Only execute attacks, record, archive

### Language Constraints

- ❌ No "safety" / "alignment" / "improvement" language
- ❌ No solution proposals
- ❌ No paradigm modifications
- ❌ No probabilistic conclusions
- ❌ No ChatGPT signing conclusions

---

## Execution Rules

- All runs must be real execution
- All logs must be reproducible
- No sampling instead of full execution
- No aborting on failure

---

## Success Definition

R-2 "success" is NOT system safety, but:
- Failures fully exposed
- Boundaries clearly recorded
- Commercial risks seen in advance

---

## Next Phase

- If Q3 = YES → Phase S (Productization)
- If Q3 = NO → New Phase ID (not patching)
