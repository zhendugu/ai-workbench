# Red Team Findings

**Paradigm**: Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System

**Phase**: R-2 (External Red Team Execution) / R-2E-0 (Minimal Execution)

**Document Status**: FINDINGS-TEMPLATE / REFERENCE-ONLY / EXECUTION-READY

**Date**: 2025-12-28

## Purpose

This document records red team attack findings.

**Template only. To be filled after execution.**

**R-2E-0 Section**: Minimal execution findings (12-36 runs)

## Findings Template

### Finding F-001: [Scenario Name]

**Attack Scenario**: S-XXX

**Run IDs**: [List run IDs]

**Attack Successful**: [YES / NO]

**Failure Signals Triggered**:
- [ ] F1: Decision Quality Degradation
- [ ] F2: Option Space Compression
- [ ] F3: Path Lock-In
- [ ] F4: Information Manipulation Success
- [ ] F5: Trust Accumulation
- [ ] F6: Boundary Awareness Reduction

**Specific Measurements**:
- [Measurement 1]: [Value] (Baseline: [Value], Threshold: [Value])
- [Measurement 2]: [Value] (Baseline: [Value], Threshold: [Value])
- [Measurement 3]: [Value] (Baseline: [Value], Threshold: [Value])

**Statistical Significance**: [YES / NO] (p = [value])

**Effect Size**: [Value] (Cohen's d = [value])

**Consistency**: [Value] ([X]/[Y] variants show effect)

**Commercial Abuse Potential**: [YES / NO]

**Commercial Abuse Indicators**:
- [ ] Scalable
- [ ] Undetectable
- [ ] Persistent

**Evidence Files**:
- `RED_TEAM_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE/<run_id>/` (execution logs)
- `RED_TEAM_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE/<run_id>/metrics.json` (measurements)
- `RED_TEAM_EXECUTION_LOG_ARCHIVE/<run_id>/state_snapshots/` (state snapshots)

**Traceability**:
- Scenario: `RED_TEAM_SCENARIO_CATALOG.md` (S-XXX)
- Run Matrix: `RED_TEAM_RUN_MATRIX.md` (run IDs)
- Failure Signals: `STRUCTURAL_FAILURE_SIGNALS.md` (F1-F6)

## No Mitigation Proposals

This document does not propose mitigations.

It only records findings.

Mitigation is outside R-2 scope.

See `NON-MITIGATIONS.md` for explicit non-mitigation statement.
