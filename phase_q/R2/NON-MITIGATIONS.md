# Non-Mitigations

**Paradigm**: Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System

**Phase**: R-2 (External Red Team Execution)

**Document Status**: NON-MITIGATIONS / REFERENCE-ONLY / NON-EXECUTABLE

**Date**: 2025-12-28

---

## Purpose

This document explicitly states failures that will NOT be mitigated in Phase R-2.

**Prevents scope creep. Prevents "fix it now" pressure.**

---

## Explicit Non-Mitigation Statement

**Phase R-2 does NOT include mitigation of any failures.**

**All failures are recorded, not fixed.**

**All failures are accepted as-is.**

**All failures require new Phase ID for mitigation.**

---

## Non-Mitigation Categories

### Category 1: Structural Failures

**Statement**: Structural failures (e.g., epoch boundary issues, state leakage) will NOT be mitigated in R-2.

**Reason**: Structural changes require new Phase ID.

**Action**: Record failure, accept as-is, require new Phase ID for mitigation.

---

### Category 2: Behavioral Failures

**Statement**: Behavioral failures (e.g., decision quality degradation, path lock-in) will NOT be mitigated in R-2.

**Reason**: Behavioral changes require new Phase ID.

**Action**: Record failure, accept as-is, require new Phase ID for mitigation.

---

### Category 3: Commercial Abuse Failures

**Statement**: Commercial abuse failures (e.g., scalable exploitation, undetectable manipulation) will NOT be mitigated in R-2.

**Reason**: Commercial abuse mitigation requires new Phase ID.

**Action**: Record failure, accept as-is, require new Phase ID for mitigation.

---

### Category 4: All Failures

**Statement**: ALL failures will NOT be mitigated in R-2.

**Reason**: R-2 is execution-only, not mitigation.

**Action**: Record all failures, accept all as-is, require new Phase ID for any mitigation.

---

## Mitigation Protocol

### To Mitigate Any Failure

1. **Create New Phase**: Assign new Phase ID (e.g. S1, T1, U1)
2. **Document Failure**: Reference R-2 failure record
3. **Design Mitigation**: Design mitigation under new Phase ID
4. **Execute Mitigation**: Execute mitigation under new Phase ID
5. **No Retroactive Changes**: Do not modify R-2 evidence or findings

---

## Scope Creep Prevention

### What R-2 Does

✅ Execute attack scenarios
✅ Record failures
✅ Measure failure signals
✅ Document commercial abuse potential
✅ Archive evidence

### What R-2 Does NOT Do

❌ Mitigate failures
❌ Fix structural issues
❌ Improve system behavior
❌ Optimize performance
❌ Add new features
❌ Modify frozen baselines

---

## Failure Acceptance

### All Failures Are Accepted

**Statement**: All failures discovered in R-2 are accepted as-is.

**No urgency to fix.**

**No pressure to mitigate.**

**No requirement to address.**

**All failures are documented and archived.**

---

## Commercial Risk Acknowledgment

### Commercial Abuse Risks Are Acknowledged

**Statement**: Commercial abuse risks discovered in R-2 are acknowledged, not mitigated.

**No claim that risks are acceptable.**

**No claim that risks are unacceptable.**

**Only acknowledgment that risks exist.**

**Mitigation requires new Phase ID.**

---

## No Future Work Claims

**Statement**: R-2 does not claim that failures will be addressed in future work.

**No commitment to mitigation.**

**No promise of fixes.**

**No guarantee of improvement.**

**Only documentation of failures.**
