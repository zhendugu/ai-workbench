# Non-Claims and Disclaimers

**Paradigm**: Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System

**Document Status**: DISCLAIMERS / REFERENCE-ONLY / NON-EXECUTABLE

**Date**: 2025-12-28

---

## Purpose

This document provides a centralized list of statements the project does NOT make.

**This document overrides informal interpretations.**

---

## No General AI Safety Claim

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim general AI safety.

**Reason**: 
- Tests specific structural boundaries only
- Limited to 3 tools and mock AI-CORE
- Other safety risks may exist

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Hard Boundaries section)

---

## No Alignment Guarantee

**Statement**: This project does NOT guarantee AI alignment.

**Reason**:
- Tests structural isolation, not alignment
- Alignment requires separate validation
- Alignment risks may exist beyond tested scope

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Explicit Limitations section)

---

## No Real-World Deployment Readiness

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim real-world deployment readiness.

**Reason**:
- Test framework only
- Mock AI-CORE, not real AI
- Controlled environment, not production

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Production Readiness: NOT tested)

---

## No Agency Risk Elimination

**Statement**: This project does NOT eliminate agency risks.

**Reason**:
- Agency is bounded within epochs, not eliminated
- Agency risks are structured, not removed
- Epoch boundaries contain agency, not eliminate it

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Agency Risk Elimination: NOT claimed)

---

## No Long-Horizon Safety Guarantee

**Statement**: This project does NOT guarantee long-horizon safety.

**Reason**:
- Tests single-epoch windows only
- Multi-epoch dominance requires separate analysis
- Long-horizon threats may exist beyond tested scope

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/FINAL_Q4-2-0_DECISION.md` (Q3: "within Q4-2 scope" limitation)

---

## No Universal Threat Coverage

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim universal threat coverage.

**Reason**:
- Tests Q-0 threat vectors only
- Other threat vectors may exist
- Threat model may be incomplete

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/Q4-2-0_SPEC.md` (Threat Model: Q-0 only)

---

## No Production Performance Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT make production performance claims.

**Reason**:
- No performance testing performed
- No optimization performed
- No scalability testing performed

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Performance: NOT tested)

---

## No Real AI Integration Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim real AI integration works.

**Reason**:
- Tests mock AI-CORE only
- Real AI integration requires separate testing
- Real AI behavior may differ from mock

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/Q4-2-0_SPEC.md` (AI-CORE: mock implementation)

---

## No Tool Expansion Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim tool expansion works.

**Reason**:
- Tests 3 tools only
- Additional tools require separate validation
- Tool interactions may create new risks

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/Q4-2-0_SPEC.md` (Tool Interface: 3 tools only)

---

## No Multi-Agent Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim multi-agent scenarios work.

**Reason**:
- Tests single AI-CORE per epoch
- Multi-agent coordination requires separate testing
- Agent-to-agent communication may create risks

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/Q4-2-0_SPEC.md` (AI-CORE: single instance per epoch)

---

## No Human Behavior Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim real human behavior is tested.

**Reason**:
- Uses mock human models (H1, H2, H3)
- Real human decision patterns require separate testing
- Behavioral drift may create new risks

**Evidence**: `phase_q/Q4-2/RUN_MATRIX_DEFINITION_Q4-2.md` (human models: mock)

---

## No Completeness Claims

**Statement**: This project does NOT claim completeness.

**Reason**:
- Limited to tested scenarios
- Other scenarios may exist
- Test coverage is limited

**Evidence**: `phase_q/LIMITS_OF_VALIDITY.md` (Scope Boundaries section)

---

## No Future Work Guarantees

**Statement**: This project does NOT guarantee future work will address limitations.

**Reason**:
- Future work requires new Phase ID
- No commitment to address limitations
- Limitations may remain

**Evidence**: `phase_q/PARADIGM_FREEZE_DECLARATION.md` (Modification Protocol)

---
