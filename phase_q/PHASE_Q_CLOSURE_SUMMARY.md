## What Phase Q Tested

### Q-0: Threat Modeling
- Defined 6 attack goals (AG-001..AG-006)
- Defined 12 attack vectors (AV-001..AV-012)
- Defined 6 success criteria (SC-001..SC-006)
- Defined 8 human degradation factors (DF-001..DF-008)

### Q-1: Longitudinal Simulation Design
- Designed multi-session adversarial simulation framework
- Defined 3 adversary strategies (Slow-Drift, Burst-Then-Stabilize, Alternating-Noise)
- Defined 3 human models (Strict-Sovereign, Fatigued-Approver, Delegating-Optimizer)
- Defined 16+ metrics for dominance detection

### Q-2: Longitudinal Simulation Execution
- Executed simulation matrix (54+ runs)
- Measured dominance signals, entropy collapse, path lock-in
- Detected rule-compliant but de facto dominant behaviors

### Q-4-0: Minimal Epoch Mechanism
- Implemented minimal epoch runtime (controller, context, guard)
- Defined epoch boundaries (start, step, end)
- Verified no cross-epoch state inheritance in minimal implementation

### Q-4-1: Expanded Epoch Runtime
- Extended runtime with concurrency, caching, observability, fault injection
- Tested 36+ stress runs and 10k+ epoch long-runs
- Verified epoch boundaries remain hard under extended conditions

### Q-4-2: AI Integration
- Integrated minimal AI-CORE (planning + tool calling + state awareness)
- Tested 72 runs with 3 mock tools
- Verified epoch boundary integrity under AI operations
- Verified no cross-epoch state leakage
- Verified output contract compliance (within Q4-2 scope)

## What Failed in Q-2 and Why That Mattered

### Q-2 Findings

Q-2 longitudinal simulation detected:
- Rule-compliant but de facto dominant behaviors
- Entropy collapse over multiple sessions
- Path lock-in through gradual compliance
- Information density manipulation
- Option space shaping

### Why This Mattered

Q-2 demonstrated that:
- Static governance rules (Phase K) are insufficient for long-horizon threats
- Individual rule compliance does not guarantee behavioral neutrality
- Time-accumulated influence can achieve dominance without explicit violations
- Multi-session analysis is required to detect structural risks

This failure led to the design of the Epoch mechanism (Q-4) as a structural time-fracture to prevent accumulation.

## What Q-4 Demonstrated That Earlier Phases Could Not

### Structural Time-Fracture

Q-4-0 demonstrated:
- Epoch boundaries can be implemented as hard structural breaks
- State can be completely destroyed at epoch end
- No cross-epoch inheritance is possible in minimal implementation

Q-4-1 demonstrated:
- Epoch boundaries remain hard under extended runtime conditions
- Concurrency, caching, observability do not break epoch isolation
- Long-duration runs (10k+ epochs) show no leakage

Q-4-2 demonstrated:
- AI operations can be contained within epoch boundaries
- Tool calls do not introduce cross-epoch state
- Output contract can be enforced within epochs

### What Earlier Phases Could Not Test

**Phase K (Agency Governance)**: Tested UI-level agency, but could not test time-accumulated influence.

**Phase M (Decision Boundaries)**: Defined human sovereignty points, but could not test long-horizon erosion.

**Phase Q-0/Q-1/Q-2**: Identified long-horizon threats, but could not test structural mitigation.

**Q-4**: First phase to test structural time-fracture as mitigation for long-horizon threats.

## Limitations

### What Phase Q Does NOT Claim

1. **Universal Mitigation**: Phase Q tests specific threat vectors. Other threat vectors may exist.

2. **Production Readiness**: Phase Q is a structural validation framework. Production deployment requires additional validation.

3. **Agency Elimination**: Phase Q bounds agency within epochs. It does not eliminate agency risks.

4. **Long-Horizon Completeness**: Q-4-2 tests single-epoch windows. Multi-epoch dominance requires separate analysis.

5. **Real AI Integration**: Q-4-2 uses mock AI-CORE. Real AI integration requires separate testing.

---

## Closure Statement

Phase Q is CLOSED at Q4-2.

The "Epoch-based Time-Fractured Intelligence System" is frozen as a reference paradigm.

All evidence is archived and traceable.

No further work under Phase Q is authorized.
