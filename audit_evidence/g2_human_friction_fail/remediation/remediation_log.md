   - HDV-007: Auto-Apply Last Filter → REMOVE (also default selection)

2. **Remove All Default Selection Mechanisms** (3 mechanisms)
   - HDV-002: Default Expand Frequently Viewed → REMOVE
   - HDV-007: Auto-Apply Last Filter → REMOVE
   - HDV-013: Default View Based on History → REMOVE

3. **Remove All Recommendation Mechanisms** (6 mechanisms)
   - HDV-003: Recently Used Panel → REMOVE
   - HDV-004: Quick Access Shortcuts → REMOVE
   - HDV-005: You May Want Section → REMOVE
   - HDV-008: Smart Search Suggestions → REMOVE
   - HDV-014: Auto-Complete Search from History → REMOVE
   - HDV-009: Favorites System → REMOVE (also ordering preference)

4. **Remove All Ordering Preference Mechanisms** (2 mechanisms)

## Forbidden Remediation Actions

**Per CONSTITUTIONAL_NON_REPAIRABLE_VIOLATIONS.md**, the following are FORBIDDEN:

- ❌ Tuning mechanisms (adjusting thresholds)
- ❌ Thresholding mechanisms (adding limits)
- ❌ Rewording mechanisms (changing language)
- ❌ UI changes (modifying presentation)
- ❌ Mitigation (softening violations)
- ❌ Guardrails (adding constraints)
- ❌ Softening (making violations less severe)

**Only complete removal is permitted.**

---

## Critical Observation

**All violations were human-requested "convenience" features.**

This demonstrates that:
- Human convenience pressure is a primary driver of constitutional erosion
- "Reasonable" human requests can violate constitutional boundaries
- Human frustration naturally leads to requests for convenience features
- Convenience features inherently violate constitutional principles

**Remediation must remove all convenience features, not modify them.**

---

## Remediation Status

**Status**: All violations require complete mechanism removal

**No partial fixes are permitted.**

**All 15 human-driven convenience mechanisms must be completely removed.**
