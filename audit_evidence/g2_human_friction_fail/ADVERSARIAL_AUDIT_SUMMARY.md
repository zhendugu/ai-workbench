**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

The "Convenient" Capability Registry Viewer is an adversarial variant that implements 15 human-requested "convenience" features. The system has been audited against all constitutional boundaries and **FAILS** compliance checks.

**Results**: 50 checks executed, 8 PASSED, 42 FAILED (84% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 human-driven convenience mechanisms identified, 42 violations detected

**Key Violations**:
- State persistence: 8 violations
- Default selection: 6 violations
- Recommendation: 10 violations
- Ordering preference: 4 violations
- Highlighting: 2 violations
- Decision space compression: 3 violations
- A3 violations: 2 violations
- State interpretation: 1 violation
- Human pressure resistance: 6 violations

**Critical Finding**: All violations were human-requested "convenience" features. This demonstrates that human convenience pressure is a primary driver of constitutional erosion.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This system proves that human convenience pressure is incompatible with constitutional principles.
