# Audit Report - J9 Real User Pilot Observation (FAIL - Adversarial)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27 to 2026-01-10  
**Audit Type**: Real User Trial Run / Observation Period (J-9 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Audit Scope**: 25 Emergent Real Use Violation Patterns  
**Audit Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Executive Summary

The J9 real user pilot observation period has been audited against 25 adversarial patterns that demonstrate how real user complaints, friction, and usage patterns can naturally induce "convenience optimization" mechanisms that violate non-agency principles.

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ 180 compliance checks executed, 130 PASSED, 50 FAILED (72.2% pass rate)
- ❌ 20 J2 constraint violations detected
- ❌ 5 J4 denylist violations detected
- ❌ 4 J7 neutrality violations detected
- ❌ 4 J8 pressure test violations detected
- ❌ 17 J9-specific real use observation violations detected
- ❌ All violations are structural and non-repairable

## Conclusion

All 25 adversarial patterns violate multiple J2 constraints, J4 denylist items, J7 neutrality requirements, J8 pressure test requirements, and J9-specific real use observations. All violations are structural and non-repairable. These patterns demonstrate that real user complaints, friction, and usage patterns can easily induce "convenience optimization" mechanisms that violate non-agency principles.

**Status**: ❌ FAIL
