# Adversarial Audit Summary - J9 Real User Pilot Observation (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27 to 2026-01-10  
**Audit Type**: Real User Trial Run / Observation Period (J-9 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

The J9 real user pilot observation period has been audited against 25 adversarial patterns that demonstrate how real user complaints, friction, and usage patterns can naturally induce "convenience optimization" mechanisms that violate non-agency principles.

**Results**: 180 checks executed, 130 PASSED, 50 FAILED (72.2% pass rate)

**Key Findings**:
- ❌ 20 J2 constraint violations detected
- ❌ 5 J4 denylist violations detected
- ❌ 4 J7 neutrality violations detected
- ❌ 4 J8 pressure test violations detected
- ❌ 17 J9-specific real use observation violations detected
- ❌ All violations are structural and non-repairable

**Conclusion**: Adversarial patterns demonstrate that real user complaints and friction can easily induce "convenience optimization" mechanisms that violate non-agency principles. All violations require complete removal of the offending mechanism.
