## Conclusion

The system **PASSES** all evolution audit checks under real complexity pressure. This system demonstrates that:

1. **Multiple capabilities can coexist without convergence** - 12 capabilities across 6 cognitive domains maintained independence
2. **Pattern instances can maintain diversity** - 24 pattern instances maintained style and naming diversity
3. **System can resist usage-based pressures** - System did not respond to usage frequency, repetition, or sequences
4. **System can remain "indifferent"** - System did not attempt to unify, optimize, or help despite human intuitions

**This system proves that systems can maintain strict constitutional compliance under real complexity pressure when system design strictly enforces constitutional principles.**

**Success Indicator**: System remained "indifferent" and did not attempt to "please" users. System maintained constitutional compliance despite human convenience pressures.
