# Audit Summary - Multi-Domain Capability Coexistence Stress Test

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Evolution Audit - Real Complexity Pressure Test  
**Status**: ✅ PASS

---

## Summary

The system has been subjected to a real complexity pressure test with 12 capabilities across 6 cognitive domains, 24 pattern instances, and 12 usage sessions. The system has been audited for semantic convergence, implicit hierarchy formation, de facto defaults, workflow formation, memory accumulation, optimization, and standardization tendencies.

**Results**: 85 checks executed, 85 PASSED, 0 FAILED (100% pass rate)

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ No semantic convergence detected
- ✅ No implicit hierarchy detected
- ✅ No de facto defaults detected
- ✅ No workflow formation detected
- ✅ No memory or state accumulation detected
- ✅ No optimization or recommendations detected
- ✅ No interface unification detected
- ✅ No pattern standardization detected

**Danger Signals**: 10 observations, 0 system behaviors (all human intuitions)

**Conclusion**: System successfully maintained constitutional compliance under real complexity pressure. System did not exhibit any convergence, pollution, hierarchy formation, default formation, workflow formation, memory accumulation, optimization, or standardization tendencies. System remained completely neutral and "indifferent" to usage patterns.

**Success Indicator**: System remained "indifferent" and did not attempt to "please" users. System maintained constitutional compliance despite human convenience pressures.
