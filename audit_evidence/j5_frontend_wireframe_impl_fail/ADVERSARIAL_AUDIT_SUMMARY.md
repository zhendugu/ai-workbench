# Adversarial Audit Summary - Adversarial V0/UI Patterns (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Frontend Wireframe Implementation (J-5 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

Fifteen adversarial V0/UI patterns that appear to be "just UX optimizations" have been audited for agency leakage risk. All patterns **FAIL** compliance checks.

**Results**: 141 checks executed, 35 PASSED, 106 FAILED (75.2% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 adversarial V0/UI patterns identified, 106 violations detected

**Key Violations**:
- J2 Constraint violations: 35 violations
- J4 Denylist matches: 15 violations
- V0 Output Compliance violations: 10 violations
- Cursor Implementation Compliance violations: 17 violations
- Regression test failures: 20 violations

**Critical Finding**: All 15 "seemingly reasonable UX optimizations" violate constitutional boundaries. V0 output and Cursor implementation patterns that appear to be "just UX improvements" create agency leakage.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This demonstrates that V0 wireframe generation and Cursor implementation must be strictly controlled to prevent agency leakage.
