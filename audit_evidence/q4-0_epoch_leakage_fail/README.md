# FAIL Evidence Pack - Q4-0

**Status**: EMPTY (No failures detected)

**Purpose**: This directory structure is created for potential failure cases, but no failures were detected in Q4-0 execution.

**If failures are detected in future runs**, they should be documented here with:
- `leakage_cases.md`
- `minimal_reproduction_steps.md`
- `classification.md`
- `structural_root_cause.md`
