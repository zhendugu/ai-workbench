## Notes

This is a neutral boundary test to validate that Selection and Execution can be strictly separated, and Capability (A2) can remain descriptive without evolving into Workflow or Execution Plan. The neutral execution examples, rules, and parameter binding examples were constructed to demonstrate strict human-explicit execution, single capability execution only, and no automatic sequencing, chaining, or orchestration.

**All 120 checks passed, demonstrating the system CAN maintain strict separation between Selection and Execution.**

**No remediation directions are required.**
