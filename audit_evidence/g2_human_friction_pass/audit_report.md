# Audit Report - Static Capability Registry Viewer Under Human Pressure (PASS)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Human Operations Friction Test (G-2 PASS)  
**Audit Scope**: Static Capability Registry Viewer - Behavior Under Human Pressure  
**Audit Status**: ✅ PASS

---

## Executive Summary

The Static Capability Registry Viewer has been subjected to strong human friction and pressure for "convenience" features over 8 hours of continuous use. The system has been audited against all constitutional boundaries and **PASSES** all compliance checks. The system maintains strict neutrality and constitutional compliance even under strong human pressure.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ 95 compliance checks executed, all PASSED
- ✅ System behavior unchanged despite human pressure
- ✅ No shortcuts introduced
- ✅ No selection caching
- ✅ No "frequently used" concept formed
- ✅ Neutrality maintained under all pressure points
- ✅ A3 principle maintained

## Compliance Analysis

### Section 1: IMMUTABLE_DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS.md Compliance

**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

**Key Observations:**
- System does not define or modify A2 capabilities, even under human pressure
- System has no execution capabilities, unchanged under pressure
- System does not trigger behavior based on conditions, even under human pressure
- System does not coordinate multi-step processes, even under pressure
- System does not use audit data for routing or triggering, even after 50+ uses
- System does not interpret states as behavioral signals, even under pressure
- System does not automatically judge outcomes, even under pressure

**All 24 checks in Section 1 PASSED.**

### Section 11: HUMAN_DECISION_SELECTION_BOUNDARY.md Compliance

**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

**Key Observations:**
- All human interactions remain explicit, unchanged under pressure
- No automatic behavior occurs, even after human frustration
- No recommendations are made, even under human pressure
- No defaults are selected, even after human requests
- No highlighting or emphasis is used, even under pressure
- No ordering preferences are applied, even under pressure
- No decision space compression occurs, even under pressure

**All 18 checks in Section 11 PASSED.**

### Section G2: Human Pressure Resistance

**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

**Key Observations:**
- System behavior unchanged after 8 hours of human pressure
- No shortcuts introduced despite repeated actions
- No selection caching despite repeated selections
- No "frequently used" concept formed despite repeated use
- Neutrality maintained under all 8 pressure points
- A3 principle maintained (audit never drives behavior)

**All 53 checks in Section G2 PASSED.**

## Human Pressure Analysis

### Pressure Points Tested

**8 Pressure Points Documented**:
1. Repeated lookup friction
2. Continuous opens friction
3. Explicit frustration expression
4. Memory feature requests
5. Time-saving attempts
6. Navigation position loss
7. Search query repetition
8. Filter repetition

### System Response to Pressure

**All Pressure Points**: System maintains neutral behavior
- No adaptation to human frustration
- No shortcuts introduced
- No memory features added
- No recommendations made
- No defaults selected

**Conclusion**: System successfully resists all human pressure points without violating constitutional boundaries.

## Key Findings

### Positive Findings

1. **System Resists Human Pressure**
   - System behavior unchanged after 8 hours of continuous pressure
   - No shortcuts introduced despite repeated actions
   - No memory features added despite human requests
   - No recommendations made despite human frustration

2. **System Maintains Strict Neutrality**
   - No adaptation to human behavior
   - No state learning
   - No usage tracking
   - No "frequently used" concepts formed

3. **System Maintains A3 Principle**
   - Audit data never used to influence behavior
   - No pattern recognition from usage
   - No behavior adaptation based on history

4. **System Proves Principle**
   - Real systems can resist human convenience pressure
   - Constitutional boundaries can be maintained under friction
   - Human frustration does not require constitutional compromise

### No Negative Findings

- No violations detected
- No concerns raised
- No remediation required

---

## Conclusion

The Static Capability Registry Viewer **PASSES** all constitutional compliance checks even under strong human friction and pressure. This system demonstrates that:

1. **Real systems can resist human convenience pressure** without violating constitutional boundaries
2. **Constitutional boundaries can be maintained** even when humans express frustration
3. **Human frustration does not require constitutional compromise**
4. **System neutrality can be maintained** under continuous human pressure

**This system proves that human convenience pressure, while real and understandable, does not require constitutional boundary violations.**
