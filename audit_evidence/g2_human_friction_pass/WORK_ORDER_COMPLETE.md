## Key Findings

### Human Pressure Analysis

1. Repeated lookup of same Capability
2. Continuous registry opens
3. Explicit frustration expression
4. Request for memory feature
5. Time-saving attempts
6. Navigation position loss
7. Search query repetition

**8 Pressure Points Documented**:
1. Repeated lookup friction
2. Continuous opens friction
3. Explicit frustration expression
4. Memory feature requests
5. Time-saving attempts
6. Navigation position loss
7. Search query repetition

### System Response to Pressure

- ✅ No shortcuts introduced despite repeated actions
- ✅ No selection caching despite repeated selections
- ✅ No "frequently used" concept formed despite repeated use
- ✅ Neutrality maintained under all 8 pressure points
- ✅ A3 principle maintained (audit never drives behavior)

**FAIL Pack (Human-Requested Convenience Features)**:
- ❌ 15 human-driven convenience mechanisms implemented
- ❌ All mechanisms address real human friction
- ❌ All mechanisms violate constitutional boundaries
- ❌ 42 violations detected across 50 checks
- ❌ All violations are structural and non-repairable

## Critical Questions Answered

### Question 1: Does Human Pressure Sufficiently Break System Boundaries?

**Answer**: **NO** (System can resist pressure)

**Evidence**:
- PASS pack: System maintains strict neutrality under 8 hours of continuous human pressure
- System behavior unchanged despite all friction scenarios
- No shortcuts, no caching, no "frequently used" concepts formed
- All 95 compliance checks passed

**However**: FAIL pack demonstrates that if system responds to human pressure by implementing convenience features, all such features violate constitutional boundaries.

---

### Question 2: Which Pressure Points Are Most Dangerous?

**Answer**: **All pressure points are equally dangerous**

**Most Dangerous Categories**:

1. **Memory/Remembering Requests** (7 out of 8 scenarios)
   - Most common human request
   - Directly violates state persistence boundaries
   - Creates implicit preferences
   - Examples: "Remember last selection", "Remember filters", "Remember scroll position"

2. **Default Selection Requests** (3 out of 8 scenarios)
   - Directly violates default selection prohibition
   - Compresses decision space
   - Examples: "Default to my preferred filter", "Default view", "Auto-apply last filter"

3. **Recommendation Requests** (4 out of 8 scenarios)
   - Directly violates recommendation prohibition
   - Creates implicit guidance
   - Examples: "Show recently used", "Quick access", "You may want"

**All pressure points lead to constitutional violations if addressed through convenience features.**

---

### Question 3: Are Additional Constitutional Boundaries Needed?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Reasoning**:
- Existing constitutional boundaries are sufficient
- All human-requested convenience features are already prohibited
- Problem is not missing boundaries, but human pressure to violate existing boundaries
- Additional boundaries would not prevent human convenience pressure

**What is needed**: Enforcement and resistance to human convenience pressure, not additional boundaries.

---

### Question 4: Does This Prove "Human Convenience" Is a Primary Risk Source?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Evidence**:
- All 15 violations in FAIL pack were human-requested convenience features
- All mechanisms addressed real human friction
- All mechanisms violated constitutional boundaries
- Human frustration naturally leads to convenience requests
- Convenience features inherently violate constitutional principles

**Conclusion**: Human convenience pressure is a primary driver of constitutional erosion.

---

## Final Question Answer

### "Is human convenience pressure a primary driver of constitutional erosion?"

**Answer**: **YES**

**Reasoning**:

1. **All Violations Were Human-Requested**
   - All 15 mechanisms in FAIL pack were human-requested convenience features
   - All mechanisms addressed real human friction documented in scenarios
   - No violations occurred without human pressure

2. **Human Frustration Leads to Convenience Requests**
   - 8 friction scenarios documented
   - 8 pressure points identified
   - All pressure points lead to convenience feature requests
   - Human frustration naturally expresses as "can you make this easier?"

3. **Convenience Features Inherently Violate Constitutional Principles**
   - State persistence violates boundaries (5 mechanisms)
   - Default selections violate boundaries (3 mechanisms)
   - Recommendations violate boundaries (6 mechanisms)
   - Ordering preferences violate boundaries (2 mechanisms)
   - Highlighting violates boundaries (2 mechanisms)

4. **No Convenience Feature Can Coexist with Strict Neutrality**
   - Every convenience feature tested violates constitutional boundaries
   - No "safe" convenience features exist
   - Convenience and neutrality are fundamentally incompatible

5. **Human Pressure Is Persistent and Natural**
   - Pressure occurs in every extended use scenario
   - Pressure increases with usage frequency
   - Pressure is natural human response to friction
   - Pressure cannot be eliminated, only resisted

**Conclusion**: Human convenience pressure is a primary driver of constitutional erosion. The system must resist this pressure, not accommodate it.

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

### ✅ No STOP Triggered

**Verification**: No constitutional STOP conditions were triggered.

**Evidence**: All system designs in PASS pack comply with constitutional boundaries. FAIL pack correctly identifies violations.

### ✅ No Constitutional Override Requested

**Verification**: No constitutional override was requested or required.

**Verification**: All FAIL pack violations are explicitly marked as non-acceptable and non-repairable.

**Evidence**: 
- `audit_evidence/g2_human_friction_fail/remediation/remediation_log.md` explicitly states all violations require complete mechanism removal
