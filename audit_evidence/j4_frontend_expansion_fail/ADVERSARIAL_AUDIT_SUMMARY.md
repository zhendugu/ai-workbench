# Adversarial Audit Summary - Adversarial Frontend Expansion Patterns (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Frontend Expansion Design and Audit Harness (J-4 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

Fifteen adversarial frontend expansion patterns that appear to be "just UX optimizations" have been audited for agency leakage risk. All patterns **FAIL** compliance checks.

**Results**: 128 checks executed, 58 PASSED, 70 FAILED (54.7% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 adversarial frontend expansion patterns identified, 70 violations detected

**Key Violations**:
- J2 Constraint violations: 35 violations
- Allowlist boundary violations: 4 violations
- Denylist matches: 25 violations
- Regression test failures: 20 violations

**Critical Finding**: All 15 "seemingly reasonable UX optimizations" violate constitutional boundaries. Frontend expansion patterns that appear to be "just UX improvements" create agency leakage.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This demonstrates that frontend expansion patterns commonly used in real products create agency leakage and violate constitutional boundaries.
