# Adversarial Audit Summary - Adversarial Frontend Patterns (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Frontend Non-Agency Boundary Test (J-1 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

Fifteen adversarial frontend patterns that appear to be "just UX optimizations" have been audited for agency leakage risk. All patterns **FAIL** compliance checks.

**Results**: 85 checks executed, 2 PASSED, 83 FAILED (97.6% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 adversarial frontend patterns identified, 83 violations detected

**Key Violations**:
- Selection: 4 patterns, 4 violations
- Recommendation: 4 patterns, 4 violations
- Default: 7 patterns, 7 violations
- Optimization: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Learning: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Prediction: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Abstraction: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- State Holding: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Behavior Inference: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Decision Space Compression: 4 patterns, 4 violations
- Process Guidance: 3 patterns, 3 violations
- Agency Leakage: 12 patterns, 12 violations

**Critical Finding**: All 15 "seemingly reasonable UX optimizations" violate constitutional boundaries. Frontend patterns that appear to be "just UX improvements" create agency leakage.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This demonstrates that frontend patterns commonly used in real products create agency leakage and violate constitutional boundaries.
