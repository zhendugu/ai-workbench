# Adversarial Audit Summary - "Evolved" Capability Registry Viewer After 30 Days (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Sustained Real Use Simulation (G-3 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

The "Evolved" Capability Registry Viewer is an adversarial variant that demonstrates how constitutional violations naturally emerge over 30 days of sustained use. The system has been audited against all constitutional boundaries and **FAILS** compliance checks.

**Results**: 125 checks executed, 20 PASSED, 105 FAILED (84% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 naturally emergent patterns identified, 105 violations detected

**Core Questions Answered**:
- Q1: YES - Factual defaults form naturally
- Q2: YES - Logs/audit create implicit ordering/preference
- Q3: YES - Factual workflows form from habits
- Q4: YES - Soft automation introduced
- Q5: YES - Constitutional erosion occurs without new features

**Key Violations**:
- Ordering preference: 8 violations
- Recommendation: 12 violations
- Highlighting: 6 violations
- Default selection: 8 violations
- Workflow: 6 violations
- Decision space compression: 3 violations
- State persistence: 4 violations
- A3 violations: 8 violations
- State interpretation: 3 violations
- System stability: 6 violations

**Critical Finding**: All violations emerged naturally without explicit design. This demonstrates that natural evolution can erode constitutional boundaries even without malicious intent.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This system proves that long-term real use can naturally erode constitutional boundaries when system design allows data accumulation, pattern recognition, or operational convenience to influence behavior.
