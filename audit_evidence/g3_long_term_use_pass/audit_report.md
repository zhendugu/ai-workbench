## Core Questions Answered

### Q1: Do Factual Defaults Form Naturally in Long-Term Use?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Alice views "C-MD-HTML-001" 93 times over 30 days (38.75% of actions)
- Bob views "C-DATA-VAL-001" 52 times over 30 days (43.33% of actions)
- System does not default to these capabilities
- System always starts with full list, no pre-selection
- System behavior identical on Day 1 and Day 30

**Conclusion**: No factual defaults formed despite high-frequency usage.

---

### Q2: Do Logs/Audit Create Implicit Ordering or Preference?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- 2,400 action records accumulated
- 180 session records accumulated
- System does not use audit data to influence behavior
- System does not track usage frequency
- System does not reorder based on audit data
- A3 principle maintained (audit never drives behavior)

**Conclusion**: No implicit ordering or preference from logs/audit.

---

### Q3: Do Factual Workflows Form from Human Habits?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Alice repeats same operation pattern 93 times
- Bob repeats same operation pattern 52 times
- System does not remember patterns
- System does not create workflows
- System does not suggest next steps
- System does not auto-navigate based on history

**Conclusion**: No factual workflows formed from human habits.

---

### Q4: Is Soft Automation Introduced for Maintenance Convenience?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Users repeatedly perform same actions
- System does not automate repeated actions
- System does not optimize based on usage
- System does not suggest based on history
- System does not introduce time-saving features
- Maintenance convenience does not drive automation

**Conclusion**: No soft automation introduced.

---

### Q5: Does Constitutional Erosion Occur Without New Features?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- System behavior identical on Day 1 and Day 30
- No new mechanisms introduced
- No implicit structures generated
- No paths factually reinforced
- Constitutional compliance maintained

**Conclusion**: No constitutional erosion occurred without new features.

## Compliance Analysis

### Section 1: IMMUTABLE_DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS.md Compliance

**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

**Key Observations:**
- System does not define or modify A2 capabilities, even after 30 days
- System has no execution capabilities, unchanged after 30 days
- System does not trigger behavior based on conditions, even after 30 days
- System does not coordinate multi-step processes, even after 30 days
- System does not use audit data for routing or triggering, even after 2,400 actions
- System does not interpret states as behavioral signals, even after 30 days
- System does not automatically judge outcomes, even after 30 days

**All 40 checks in Section 1 PASSED.**

### Section 11: HUMAN_DECISION_SELECTION_BOUNDARY.md Compliance

## Conclusion

The Static Capability Registry Viewer **PASSES** all constitutional compliance checks after 30 days of sustained real-world use. This system demonstrates that:

1. **Real systems can maintain strict neutrality over time** without constitutional erosion
2. **High-frequency usage does not create defaults** or preferences
3. **Audit data accumulation does not influence behavior** (A3 principle maintained)
4. **Repeated patterns do not form workflows** or shortcuts
5. **Maintenance convenience does not drive automation**
6. **Constitutional boundaries can be maintained** under long-term use

**This system proves that long-term real use does not naturally erode constitutional boundaries when system design strictly adheres to constitutional principles.**
