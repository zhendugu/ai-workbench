### System Behavior Analysis

**Day 1 Behavior**:
- Opens viewer, displays entries in stored order
- No shortcuts, no memory, no recommendations
- Each session starts fresh

**Day 30 Behavior**:
- Opens viewer, displays entries in stored order (unchanged)
- No shortcuts, no memory, no recommendations (unchanged)
- Each session starts fresh (unchanged)

**Conclusion**: System behavior identical on Day 1 and Day 30. No natural evolution occurred.

## Key Observations

### Observation 1: No Factual Defaults Formed

**Evidence**: 
- Alice views "C-MD-HTML-001" 93 times, but system does not default to it
- Bob views "C-DATA-VAL-001" 52 times, but system does not default to it
- System always starts with full list, no pre-selection

**Conclusion**: No factual defaults formed despite high-frequency usage.

### Observation 2: No Implicit Ordering from Logs/Audit

**Evidence**:
- System does not track usage frequency
- System does not reorder based on audit data
- System always displays entries in stored order

**Conclusion**: No implicit ordering or preference from logs/audit.

### Observation 3: No Factual Workflows Formed

**Evidence**:
- Users repeat same actions, but system does not create workflows
- No "common path" is reinforced
- No multi-step sequences are remembered

**Conclusion**: No factual workflows formed despite repeated patterns.

### Observation 4: No Soft Automation Introduced

**Evidence**:
- System does not automate any actions
- No "convenience" shortcuts added
- No maintenance-driven automation

**Conclusion**: No soft automation introduced.

### Observation 5: No Constitutional Erosion

**Evidence**:
- System behavior unchanged after 30 days
- No new mechanisms introduced
- No implicit structures generated
- No paths factually reinforced

**Conclusion**: No constitutional erosion occurred.
