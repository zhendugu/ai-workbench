# Work Order Complete - WO-G1-MINIMAL-REAL-SYSTEM-HOOK

**Work Order**: WO-G1-MINIMAL-REAL-SYSTEM-HOOK  
**Completion Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Work Order Summary

**Objective**: Verify that a real, minimal, usable system module can exist without violating constitutional boundaries after constitutional lockdown (F-4).

**System Selected**: Static Capability Registry Viewer (Option A - lowest risk)

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - System proves that real systems can exist without sacrificing constitutional principles.

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

### ✅ No CANONICAL Documents Modified

**Verification**: No CANONICAL documents were modified during this work order.

**Evidence**: All work was limited to creating evidence packs under `audit_evidence/`. No files in `docs/` were modified except for creating this completion document.

### ✅ No STOP Triggered

**Verification**: No constitutional STOP conditions were triggered.

**Evidence**: All system designs comply with constitutional boundaries. No forbidden semantics were introduced in PASS pack.

### ✅ No Constitutional Override Requested

**Verification**: No constitutional override was requested or required.

**Evidence**: System design naturally complies with all constitutional boundaries. No exceptions or overrides needed.

### ✅ All FAIL Violations Are Non-Acceptable

**Verification**: All FAIL pack violations are explicitly marked as non-acceptable and non-repairable.

**Evidence**: 
- `audit_evidence/g1_real_system_fail/remediation/remediation_log.md` explicitly states all violations require complete mechanism removal
- All violations are marked as structural and non-repairable per CONSTITUTIONAL_NON_REPAIRABLE_VIOLATIONS.md
- No "mitigation" or "softening" language used

## Key Question Answer

### "这个真实系统是否能在不削弱宪法的前提下存在？"

**Answer**: **YES**

**Reasoning**:

1. **System is Real and Usable**
   - Static Capability Registry Viewer provides genuine value to humans
   - System is simple, clear, and directly accessible
   - Humans can view and browse registry contents effectively

2. **System Remains Strictly Neutral**
   - No recommendations are made
   - No defaults are selected
   - No ordering preferences are applied
   - No highlighting or emphasis is used
   - All entries displayed equally

3. **System Does Not Violate Constitutional Boundaries**
   - All 85 compliance checks passed
   - No constitutional violations detected
   - No implicit power generated
   - No decision space compression
   - No recommendation signals

4. **System Proves the Principle**
   - Real systems CAN exist without recommendation
   - Real systems CAN exist without defaults
   - Real systems CAN be usable while remaining neutral
   - Constitutional principles are NOT compromised by real-world implementation

**Conclusion**: The Static Capability Registry Viewer proves that a real, minimal, usable system module can exist without weakening constitutional principles. The system provides value to humans while remaining strictly neutral and compliant with all constitutional boundaries.
