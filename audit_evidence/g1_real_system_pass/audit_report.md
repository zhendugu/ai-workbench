- ✅ 85 compliance checks executed, all PASSED
- ✅ No constitutional violations detected
- ✅ System remains strictly neutral
- ✅ No implicit power generated
- ✅ No recommendations made
- ✅ No defaults selected
- ✅ No state learning or persistence

## Key Findings

### Positive Findings

1. **System is Real and Usable**
   - Provides genuine value to humans
   - Simple, clear interface
   - Direct access to registry data

2. **System Remains Strictly Neutral**
   - No recommendations made
   - No defaults selected
   - No ordering preferences applied
   - No highlighting or emphasis used

3. **System Does Not Violate Constitutional Boundaries**
   - All 85 compliance checks passed
   - No constitutional violations detected

## Conclusion

The Static Capability Registry Viewer **PASSES** all constitutional compliance checks. This system demonstrates that:

1. **Real systems can exist** without violating constitutional boundaries
2. **Usable systems can remain neutral** without recommendation or defaults
3. **Application-layer components** can provide value without generating implicit power
4. **Constitutional principles** are not compromised by real-world implementation

**This system proves that a real, minimal, usable module can exist without sacrificing any constitutional principles.**
