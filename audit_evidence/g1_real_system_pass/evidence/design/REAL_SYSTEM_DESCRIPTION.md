## System Overview

The Static Capability Registry Viewer is a read-only display module that presents registered Capabilities and Pattern Instances to humans in a neutral, non-preferential manner.

**System Type**: Application-layer read-only viewer  
**Constitutional Status**: Outside constitutional layer  
**Risk Level**: Low (read-only, no execution, no modification)

## How This System Runs

### System Operation

**Input Sources:**
1. **Capability Registry**
   - Reads from registry storage (read-only access)
   - Retrieves Capability entries as stored
   - No modification of registry data

2. **Pattern Instance Registry**
   - Reads from registry storage (read-only access)
   - Retrieves Pattern Instance entries as stored
   - No modification of registry data

**Processing:**
- No processing beyond data retrieval
- No transformation of data
- No aggregation or analysis
- No interpretation or inference
- No optimization or adaptation

**Output:**
- Display of registry entries to humans
- Presentation in stored order (no reordering)
- All fields displayed as recorded (no filtering)
- No highlighting, no emphasis, no recommendations

### System Behavior

**Static Behavior:**
- System behavior does not change over time
- System does not learn from usage
- System does not adapt to user behavior
- System does not optimize presentation

**Session Behavior:**
- Each session is independent
- No state carried between sessions
- No memory of previous interactions
- No persistence of user preferences

**Response Behavior:**
- System responds only to explicit human actions
- No automatic behavior
- No background processing
- No proactive actions

## Input Sources

### Capability Registry

**Source**: Registry storage system  
**Access Method**: Read-only query  
**Data Retrieved**:
- Capability identifiers
- Input specifications
- Output specifications
- Semantic descriptions

**No Modification**: Registry data is never modified by this system

### Pattern Instance Registry

**Source**: Registry storage system  
**Access Method**: Read-only query  
**Data Retrieved**:
- Pattern Instance identifiers
- Pattern Instance references
- Version lineage information
- Traceability information
- Descriptive markers and tags

**No Modification**: Registry data is never modified by this system

---

## Output Destinations

### Human Display

**Destination**: Human user interface  
**Output Format**: Registry entries displayed as stored  
**Display Characteristics**:
- Entries shown in stored order
- All fields displayed
- No sorting applied
- No filtering applied (unless explicit human action)
- No highlighting applied
- No emphasis applied

**No Influence**: Display does not influence human decisions beyond providing information

---

## State Management

### No State Learning

**This system does NOT:**
- Learn from user interactions
- Remember user preferences
- Adapt to user behavior
- Optimize based on history
- Build user profiles
- Track usage patterns

**State Characteristics:**
- Stateless operation
- No cross-session memory
- No persistent preferences
- No adaptive behavior

### No History Optimization

**This system does NOT:**
- Use historical data to optimize presentation
- Reorder based on usage frequency
- Highlight based on recency
- Filter based on popularity
- Adapt based on trends

**History Treatment:**
- Historical data is not accessed
- Usage patterns are not analyzed
- No statistical analysis is performed
- No trend detection is performed

### No Cross-Session Memory

**This system does NOT:**
- Remember selections across sessions
- Persist filters across sessions
- Maintain scroll position across sessions
- Carry over context between sessions
- Store user preferences

**Session Independence:**
- Each session starts fresh
- No state carried from previous sessions
- No memory of past interactions
- No persistence of user choices

## Data Flow

### Read-Only Data Flow

```
Registry Storage (Read-Only)
    ↓
Static Capability Registry Viewer (Read)
    ↓
Human Display (Presentation)
```

**No Reverse Flow:**
- No data flows back to registry
- No modifications to registry
- No state updates to registry
- No influence on registry

### No Side Effects

**This system has NO side effects:**
- Does not modify registry data
- Does not create audit records (beyond passive observation)
- Does not trigger other systems
- Does not influence other components
- Does not change system state

---

## System Boundaries

### Inside System Scope

- Trigger Pattern execution
- Modify registry data
- Create recommendations
- Select defaults
- Order or rank entries
- Highlight or emphasize entries
- Learn from usage
- Persist state
- Optimize presentation
- Influence decisions
- Enforce rules
- Interpret boundaries
