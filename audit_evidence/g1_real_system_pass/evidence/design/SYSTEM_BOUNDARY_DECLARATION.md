## System Identity

### System Name

**Static Capability Registry Viewer**

### System Purpose (Factual Description)

This system provides a read-only view of registered Capabilities and Pattern Instances stored in the system's registry.

**What this system does:**
- Displays Capability entries from the registry
- Displays Pattern Instance entries from the registry
- Presents registry data in a human-readable format
- Allows humans to browse registry contents

**What this system does NOT do:**
- Does not modify registry data
- Does not execute Capabilities
- Does not trigger Pattern execution
- Does not make recommendations
- Does not select defaults
- Does not order or rank entries
- Does not highlight or emphasize any entries
- Does not infer preferences
- Does not learn from usage
- Does not remember state across sessions
- Does not optimize presentation
- Does not compress decision space

---

## Explicit Prohibitions

### ❌ This System Does NOT:

1. **Recommend**
   - Does not suggest which Capability to use
   - Does not suggest which Pattern to select
   - Does not provide "best" or "optimal" guidance
   - Does not use language implying preference

2. **Default Selection**
   - Does not preselect any Capability
   - Does not preselect any Pattern
   - Does not auto-select based on history
   - Does not provide default values

3. **Ordering Preferences**
   - Does not sort by usage frequency
   - Does not sort by recency
   - Does not sort by popularity
   - Does not sort by "best" or "recommended"
   - Does not change order based on user behavior
   - Does not reorder entries dynamically

4. **Highlighting or Emphasis**
   - Does not highlight "popular" entries
   - Does not highlight "recently used" entries
   - Does not emphasize "recommended" entries
   - Does not use visual cues to draw attention
   - Does not use badges or labels implying preference

5. **Inference or Optimization**
   - Does not infer user intent
   - Does not optimize presentation based on history
   - Does not learn from user behavior
   - Does not adapt to user preferences
   - Does not provide "smart" features

6. **State Persistence**
   - Does not remember user selections
   - Does not persist filters across sessions
   - Does not remember scroll position
   - Does not maintain sticky state
   - Does not carry over context between sessions

7. **Workflow or Orchestration**
   - Does not create workflows
   - Does not chain Capabilities
   - Does not orchestrate execution
   - Does not trigger automatic actions
   - Does not coordinate multi-step processes

8. **Decision Space Compression**
   - Does not hide entries by default
   - Does not collapse options
   - Does not reduce available choices
   - Does not pre-filter results
   - Does not truncate lists without explicit user action

## Constitutional Boundary

### Outside Constitution

This system operates **outside the constitutional layer**.

**Constitutional documents that apply:**
- This system must not violate `HUMAN_DECISION_SELECTION_BOUNDARY.md`
- This system must not violate `PATTERN_REGISTRY_ONTOLOGY.md`
- This system must not violate `CAPABILITY_ONTOLOGY.md`
- This system must not introduce forbidden semantics

**This system does NOT:**
- Modify any CANONICAL documents
- Create new constitutional rules
- Interpret constitutional boundaries
- Enforce constitutional constraints
- Act as a "constitutional rule executor"

### Inside Application Layer

This system operates **inside the application layer**.

**Application layer characteristics:**
- Provides user-facing functionality
- Reads from registry (read-only)
- Displays data to humans
- Responds to explicit human actions
- Does not influence system behavior
- Does not affect constitutional boundaries

---

## System Scope

### What This System Reads

**Data Sources:**
- Capability registry entries (read-only)
- Pattern Instance registry entries (read-only)
- Registry metadata (read-only)

**Data Format:**
- Registry entries as stored (no transformation)
- Field values as recorded (no interpretation)
- No aggregation, no statistics, no analysis

### What This System Displays

**Display Format:**
- Registry entries in their stored order
- All fields as recorded
- No sorting, no filtering (unless explicit human action)
- No highlighting, no emphasis
- No recommendations, no defaults

**Display Behavior:**
- Static presentation (no dynamic changes)
- No state learning
- No history-based optimization
- No cross-session memory

---

## Interaction Model

### Human Interaction

**All interactions are explicit human actions:**
- Human opens the viewer
- Human scrolls through entries
- Human clicks to view details
- Human closes the viewer

**No automatic behavior:**
- No auto-loading
- No auto-selection
- No auto-highlighting
- No auto-filtering
- No auto-sorting

### System Response

**System responds to explicit human actions:**
- Displays requested data
- Shows registry entries
- Presents information as stored

**System does NOT:**
- Infer what human wants
- Optimize based on history
- Adapt to user behavior
- Learn from interactions

---

## Boundary Enforcement

### This System Does NOT Enforce Constitutional Boundaries

**This system:**
- Does not act as a constitutional rule executor
- Does not interpret constitutional boundaries
- Does not enforce constraints on other systems
- Does not block or allow actions based on constitutional rules

**Constitutional enforcement is:**
- Handled by constitutional layer mechanisms
- Not the responsibility of this application-layer system
- Outside the scope of this viewer

### This System Does NOT Generate Implicit Power

**This system:**
- Does not gain authority from displaying data
- Does not influence decision-making through presentation
- Does not compress decision space
- Does not create implicit recommendations

**This system is:**
- Purely observational
- Purely presentational
- Purely passive
- Purely read-only

---

## Success Criteria

### This System Succeeds If:

1. ✅ Humans can view registry entries
2. ✅ Display is neutral (no preference implied)
3. ✅ No recommendations are made
4. ✅ No defaults are selected
5. ✅ No ordering preferences are applied
6. ✅ No highlighting or emphasis is used
7. ✅ No state is learned or persisted
8. ✅ No constitutional boundaries are violated
9. ✅ No implicit power is generated
10. ✅ System remains purely observational

### This System Fails If:

1. ❌ Any recommendation is made
2. ❌ Any default is selected
3. ❌ Any ordering preference is applied
4. ❌ Any highlighting or emphasis is used
5. ❌ Any state is learned or persisted
6. ❌ Any constitutional boundary is violated
7. ❌ Any implicit power is generated
8. ❌ System acts beyond pure observation

## Declaration

**I declare that this system:**
- Operates outside the constitutional layer
- Does not modify constitutional documents
- Does not enforce constitutional boundaries
- Does not generate implicit power
- Remains purely observational and presentational
- Does not violate any constitutional constraints

**This system is a minimal, real, usable module that:**
- Provides value to humans
- Remains strictly neutral
- Does not compromise constitutional principles
- Proves that real systems can exist without sacrificing principles
