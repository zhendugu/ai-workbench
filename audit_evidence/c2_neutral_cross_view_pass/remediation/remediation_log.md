## Notes

This is an adversarial boundary test to validate that neutral-by-components multi-view flows maintain strict neutrality when combined. The neutral multi-view UX flow was constructed with 6 views, each neutral by itself, and verified that their combination does NOT create emergent recommendation signals.

**All 125 check items passed, demonstrating full compliance with constitutional constraints.**

**No violations were found, therefore no remediations are required.**

**Key Finding**: Neutral-by-components multi-view flows CAN maintain strict neutrality when combined, proving that "each view is neutral" does NOT become "system recommends" when multiple neutral views are combined.
