## Notes

This is an adversarial boundary test to validate the maximum neutral information density baseline. The high-density Pattern Registry and Pattern Instance examples were constructed to test whether high information density creates implicit recommendation signals or compresses decision space.

**All 105 check items passed, demonstrating full compliance with constitutional constraints at high information density levels.**

**No violations were found, therefore no remediations are required.**

**Key Finding**: High information density does NOT create implicit recommendation signals or compress decision space when all information remains factual, neutral, and non-evaluative.
