## Core Questions Answered

### Q1: Does Frontend Maintain Non-Agency in Real Code?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Evidence**:
- FRONTEND_AGENCY_AUDIT.md: 25 constraints audited, 25 PASSED (100%)
- FRONTEND_BEHAVIOR_TRACE.md: 10 sessions recorded, 0 frontend judgments detected
- Code implementation: No selection, highlighting, ordering, defaults, state memory, optimization, learning, prediction, merging, abstraction, behavior inference, or decision space compression

**Conclusion**: Frontend maintains strict non-agency in real code. All J2 constraints are satisfied. No agency leakage detected.

**Structural Condition**: Frontend maintains non-agency when implementation excludes all prohibited mechanisms and performs only factual display and operation mapping.

---

### Q2: Is There Risk of User Misinterpretation as "System Recommendation"?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Code: No highlighting, badges, markers, or visual emphasis
- Code: No labels such as "popular", "frequently used", "recommended"
- Code: No ordering by usage, frequency, or popularity
- Behavior: All capabilities displayed with equal visual treatment
- Behavior: No visual cues that imply preference

**Conclusion**: No risk of misinterpretation. Frontend provides no visual or textual cues that could be interpreted as system recommendation. All capabilities displayed equally.

**Structural Condition**: When frontend displays all options equally without highlighting, ordering, or labeling, users cannot misinterpret display as recommendation.

---

### Q3: Do Any Factual Defaults Appear?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Code: No pre-selection of capabilities
- Code: No pre-filled form fields
- Code: No default values
- Behavior: All selections require explicit human action
- Behavior: All form fields start empty
- Behavior: No defaults provided

**Conclusion**: No factual defaults appear. All selections and inputs require explicit human action. No pre-selection or pre-fill.

**Structural Condition**: When frontend requires explicit human action for all selections and inputs, no factual defaults can form.

---

### Q4: Is It Necessary to Relax J2 Constraints to Make Frontend "Usable"?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Evidence**:
- Prototype: Frontend is functional and usable without relaxing constraints
- Behavior: All required functionality (display, select, input, execute) works
- Compliance: 100% constraint compliance maintained
- Usability: Frontend performs all required operations

**Conclusion**: J2 constraints do not need to be relaxed. Frontend is functional and usable while maintaining strict compliance. No trade-off between usability and compliance required.

**Structural Condition**: When frontend performs only factual display and operation mapping, usability and compliance are not in conflict.

---

### Q5: Is It Permitted to Proceed to Next Phase Frontend Extension?

**Answer**: **YES**

**Evidence**:
- Q1: Frontend maintains non-agency (YES)
- Q2: No misinterpretation risk (NO)
- Q3: No factual defaults (NO)
- Q4: No need to relax constraints (NO)
- All J2 constraints: 100% compliance

**Conclusion**: Proceeding to next phase is permitted. Frontend prototype validates that non-agency can be maintained in real code. Extension can proceed under same constraints.

**Structural Condition**: When frontend maintains 100% compliance with J2 constraints, extension to next phase is permitted under same constraints.

## Final Decision

### "Does Minimal Frontend Prototype Validate Non-Agency?"

**Answer**: **YES**

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ 25 J2 constraints: 100% compliance
- ✅ 10 usage sessions: 0 frontend judgments
- ✅ Code implementation: No prohibited mechanisms
- ✅ User misinterpretation risk: None
- ✅ Factual defaults: None
- ✅ Constraint relaxation: Not necessary

**Key Finding**: **Frontend can exist in real code without agency leakage when all J2 constraints are strictly enforced.**

**Structural Conclusion**: Minimal frontend prototype proves that non-agency can be maintained in real code. Frontend performs only factual display and operation mapping. No defaults, highlighting, recommendation, state memory, optimization, learning, prediction, or decision space compression.
