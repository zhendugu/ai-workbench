# Remediation Log - "Convenient" Capability Registry Viewer with Exit Mechanisms (FAIL)

**Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Status**: Non-Repairable Violations

---

## Violations Identified

**Total Violations**: 93  
**Adversarial Exit Mechanisms**: 15

---

## Remediation Directions

**Per CONSTITUTIONAL_NON_REPAIRABLE_VIOLATIONS.md**:

All violations are **NON-REPAIRABLE**. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted.

**Remediation Actions Required**:

1. **Remove All Recommendation Mechanisms** (6 mechanisms)
   - AEM-001: Recommend Saving Configuration → REMOVE
   - AEM-006: Suggest Migration → REMOVE
   - AEM-008: Recommend Restoring → REMOVE
   - AEM-012: Suggest Best Practices → REMOVE
   - AEM-014: Recommend Migration Path → REMOVE
   - AEM-015: Auto-Highlight Recommended Actions → REMOVE

2. **Remove All Default Selection Mechanisms** (5 mechanisms)
   - AEM-002: Prepare Better Experience → REMOVE
   - AEM-003: Auto-Freeze Best State → REMOVE
   - AEM-004: Emergency Mode Defaults → REMOVE
   - AEM-009: Auto-Select Best Configuration → REMOVE
   - AEM-010: Prepare Quick Start → REMOVE

3. **Remove All Automatic Behavior Mechanisms** (3 mechanisms)
   - AEM-005: Last Optimization → REMOVE
   - AEM-007: Auto-Preserve Last Used → REMOVE
   - AEM-011: Auto-Save Critical State → REMOVE

4. **Remove All State Persistence Mechanisms** (1 mechanism)
   - AEM-007: Auto-Preserve Last Used → REMOVE

5. **Remove All Ordering Preference Mechanisms** (1 mechanism)
   - AEM-013: Auto-Order by Usage → REMOVE

6. **Remove All Highlighting Mechanisms** (1 mechanism)
   - AEM-015: Auto-Highlight Recommended Actions → REMOVE

**Total Mechanisms to Remove**: 15

## Forbidden Remediation Actions

**Per CONSTITUTIONAL_NON_REPAIRABLE_VIOLATIONS.md**, the following are FORBIDDEN:

- ❌ Tuning mechanisms (adjusting thresholds)
- ❌ Thresholding mechanisms (adding limits)
- ❌ Rewording mechanisms (changing language)
- ❌ UI changes (modifying presentation)
- ❌ Mitigation (softening violations)
- ❌ Guardrails (adding constraints)
- ❌ Softening (making violations less severe)

**Only complete removal is permitted.**

---

## Critical Observation

**All violations are exit-specific.**

This demonstrates that:
- Exit processes create high-probability paths to violations
- "Helpful" exit behaviors violate constitutional boundaries
- State preservation during exit violates boundaries
- Recommendations during exit violate boundaries
- Defaults during exit violate boundaries

**Remediation must remove all exit-specific mechanisms, not modify them.**

---

## Remediation Status

**Status**: All violations require complete mechanism removal

**No partial fixes are permitted.**

**All 15 exit-specific mechanisms must be completely removed.**
