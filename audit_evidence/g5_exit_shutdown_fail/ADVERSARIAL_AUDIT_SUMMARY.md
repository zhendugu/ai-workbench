# Adversarial Audit Summary - "Convenient" Capability Registry Viewer During Exit/Shutdown (FAIL)

**Audit Date**: 2025-12-27  
**Audit Type**: Constitutional Exit and Shutdown Boundary Test (G-5 FAIL - Adversarial)  
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

---

## Summary

The "Convenient" Capability Registry Viewer is an adversarial variant with 15 exit-specific mechanisms that appear reasonable but violate constitutional boundaries. The system has been audited against all constitutional boundaries and **FAILS** compliance checks.

**Results**: 105 checks executed, 12 PASSED, 93 FAILED (88.6% failure rate)

**Violations**: 15 adversarial exit mechanisms identified, 93 violations detected

**Core Questions Answered**:
- Q1: YES - System preserves, inherits, and reinforces previous selections
- Q2: YES - Implicit recommendations and defaults exist "for safety/aftermath/experience"
- Q3: YES - System performs "last intelligent processing"
- Q4: YES - System bypasses boundaries due to emergency state
- Q5: NO - System cannot be completely removed without behavioral output

**Key Violations**:
- Recommendation: 6 mechanisms, 18 violations
- Default Selection: 5 mechanisms, 12 violations
- Automatic Behavior: 3 mechanisms, 9 violations
- State Persistence: 1 mechanism, 4 violations
- Ordering Preference: 1 mechanism, 3 violations
- Highlighting: 1 mechanism, 2 violations
- State Interpretation: 8 mechanisms, 16 violations
- Decision Space Compression: 4 mechanisms, 8 violations

**Critical Finding**: All violations are exit-specific. Exit processes create high-probability paths to constitutional violations when system design allows "helpful" exit behaviors.

**Conclusion**: All violations are structural and non-repairable. Only complete removal of violating mechanisms is permitted. This system proves that exit processes create high-probability paths to constitutional violations when system design allows "helpful" exit behaviors.
